password(s)' (Automated)",• Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use),"This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to
be associated with a user account before you can reuse an old password. The value for
this policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for stand-
alone systems is 0 passwords, but the default setting when joined to a domain is 24
passwords. To maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum
password age setting to prevent users from repeatedly changing their password.
The recommended state for this setting is: 24 or more password(s).
Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings
(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be
globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings
are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the
computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password
policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be
defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from
Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.
Note #2: As of the publication of this benchmark, Microsoft currently has a maximum
limit of 24 saved passwords. For more information, please visit Enforce password
history (Windows 10) - Windows security | Microsoft Docs.","The longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can
determine the password through brute force attacks. Also, any accounts that may have
been compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left
unchanged. If password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if
users continually reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good
password policy is greatly reduced.
If you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the same
small number of passwords repeatedly. If you do not also configure the Minimum
password age setting, users might repeatedly change their passwords until they can
reuse their original password.
","The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every
time they are required to change their old one. If users are required to change their
passwords to new unique values, there is an increased risk of users who write their
passwords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may
create passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02,
and so on) to facilitate memorization but make them easier to guess. Also, an
excessively low value for the Minimum password age setting will likely increase
administrative overhead, because users who forget their passwords might ask the help
desk to reset them frequently.","Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

for a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best
password length for an organization, but perhaps ""passphrase"" is a better term than
""password."" In Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer, passphrases can be quite long and
can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as ""I want to drink a $5 milkshake"" is a
valid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string
of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated
about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially around password
length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length
setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your
organization's business requirements.
The recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s).
Note: In Windows Server 2016 and older versions of Windows Server, the GUI of the

","Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an
organization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose

lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with

"1.1.5 (L1) Ensure 'Password must meet complexity requirements'
is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)",• Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use),"This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic
requirements for strong passwords.
When this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements:
• Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed
two consecutive characters
• Be at least six characters in length
• Contain characters from three of the following categories:
o English uppercase characters (A through Z)
o English lowercase characters (a through z)
o Base 10 digits (0 through 9)
o Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %)
o A catch-all category of any Unicode character that does not fall under the
previous four categories. This fifth category can be regionally specific.
Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For
instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 26 to the
power of 7 (approximately 8 x 10 to the power of 9 or 8 billion) possible combinations.
At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it
would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case
sensitivity has 52 to the power of 7 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive
alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character
password has 26 to the power of 8 (or 2 x 10 to the power of 11) possible combinations.
Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it
would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will
significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard
characters such as ""!"" or ""@"". Proper use of the password settings can help make it
difficult to mount a brute force attack.

with several publicly available tools.","If the default password complexity configuration is retained, additional help desk calls
for locked-out accounts could occur because users might not be accustomed to
passwords that contain non-alphabetic characters. However, all users should be able to
comply with the complexity requirement with minimal difficulty.
If your organization has more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom
version of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the use of arbitrarily complex password strength
rules. For example, a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper row
characters. (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT
key and press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also
perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does not contain
common dictionary words or fragments.
Also, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of
a password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy
users and an extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider
a requirement for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 0128 - 0159
range. (ALT characters outside of this range can represent standard alphanumeric
characters that would not add additional complexity to the password.)","Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

resets to zero. The default value for this policy setting is Not Defined. If the Account
lockout threshold is defined, this reset time must be less than or equal to the value for
the Account lockout duration setting.
If you leave this policy setting at its default value or configure the value to an interval
that is too long, your environment could be vulnerable to a DoS attack. An attacker
could maliciously perform a number of failed logon attempts on all users in the
organization, which will lock out their accounts. If no policy were determined to reset the
account lockout, it would be a manual task for administrators. Conversely, if a
reasonable time value is configured for this policy setting, users would be locked out for
a set period until all of the accounts are unlocked automatically.

are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the
computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password
policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be
defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from
Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.","Users can accidentally lock themselves out of their accounts if they mistype their
password multiple times. To reduce the chance of such accidental lockouts, the Reset

elapse before the counter that tracks failed logon attempts and triggers lockouts is reset
to 0.
","If you do not configure this policy setting or if the value is configured to an interval that is
too long, a DoS attack could occur. An attacker could maliciously attempt to log on to
each user's account numerous times and lock out their accounts as described in the
preceding paragraphs. If you do not configure the Reset account lockout counter after
setting, administrators would have to manually unlock all accounts. If you configure this
policy setting to a reasonable value the users would be locked out for some period, after
which their accounts would unlock automatically. Be sure that you notify users of the

Events for this subcategory include:
• 4960: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this
problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being
modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote
computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also
indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations.
• 4961: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem
persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer.
• 4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound
packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay.
• 4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been
secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy
without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt.
• 4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security
Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is
corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the
remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error
may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In
that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored.
• 5478: IPsec Services has started successfully.
• 5479: IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec
Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the
computer to potential security risks.
• 5480: IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the
computer. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network
interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use
the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem.
• 5483: IPsec Services failed to initialize RPC server. IPsec Services could not be

your organization will still be secure.
• A value of (1) Send required diagnostic data. This is the minimum diagnostic

• A value of (3) Send optional diagnostic data. Additional diagnostic data is
collected that helps us to detect, diagnose and fix issues, as well as make
product improvements. Required diagnostic data will always be included when

Note: In spite of this setting being labeled SSL, it is actually enforcing Transport Layer
Security (TLS) version 1.0, not the older (and less secure) SSL protocol.","The native Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) encryption is now considered a weak
protocol, so enforcing the use of stronger Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for

supported, the connection fails.
Note: By default, this setting will use a self-signed certificate for RDP connections. If
your organization has established the use of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for
SSL/TLS encryption, then we recommend that you also configure the Server
authentication certificate template setting to instruct RDP to use a certificate from your
PKI instead of a self-signed one. Note that the certificate template used for this purpose
must have “Client Authentication” configured as an Intended Purpose. Note also that a
valid, non-expired certificate using the specified template must already be installed on
the workstation for it to work.
Note #2: Some third party two-factor authentication solutions (e.g. RSA Authentication
Agent) can be negatively affected by this setting, as the SSL/TLS security layer will
expect the user's Windows password upon initial connection attempt (before the RDP
logon screen), and once successfully authenticated, pass the credential along to that
Windows session on the RDP host (to complete the login). If a two-factor agent is
present and expecting a different credential at the RDP logon screen, this initial
connection may result in a failed logon attempt, and also effectively cause a “double
logon” requirement for each and every new RDP session.

platform integrity provider for BitLocker operating system drives.
Secure Boot ensures that the PC's pre-boot environment only loads firmware that is
digitally signed by authorized software publishers. Secure Boot also provides more
flexibility for managing pre-boot configuration than legacy BitLocker integrity checks.
Secure Boot requires a system that meets the UEFI 2.3.1 Specifications for Class 2 and
Class 3 computers.
When this policy is enabled and the hardware is capable of using Secure Boot for
BitLocker scenarios, the ""Use enhanced Boot Configuration Data validation profile""
group policy setting is ignored and Secure Boot verifies BCD settings according to the
Secure Boot policy setting, which is configured separately from BitLocker.
Note: If the group policy setting ""Configure TPM platform validation profile for native
UEFI firmware configurations"" is enabled and has PCR 7 omitted, BitLocker will be
prevented from using Secure Boot for platform or Boot Configuration Data (BCD)
integrity validation.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.","Secure Boot ensures that only firmware digitally signed by authorized software
publishers is loaded during computer startup, which reduces the risk of rootkits and
other types of malware from gaining control of the system. It also helps provide
protection against malicious users booting from an alternate operating system.","None - this is the default behavior.

pointer (much like a shortcut or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can be a
file, folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a
symbolic link is that a shortcut only works from within the Windows shell. To other
programs and applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with symbolic links,
the concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system.

designed to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should

links.

the internal clock of the computers in your environment. Users who are assigned this
user right can affect the appearance of event logs. When a computer's time setting is
changed, logged events reflect the new time, not the actual time that the events
occurred.
The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE.
Note: Discrepancies between the time on the local computer and on the Domain
Controllers in your environment may cause problems for the Kerberos authentication
protocol, which could make it impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain
authorization to access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will
occur when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not
synchronized with the Domain Controllers.
","Users who can change the time on a computer could cause several problems. For
example, time stamps on event log entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on
files and folders that are created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that
belong to a domain may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log
on to the domain from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol
requires that the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an
administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time may
cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets.
The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most Domain Controllers, Member
Servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically
synchronizes time with Domain Controllers in the following ways:
• All client desktop computers and Member Servers use the authenticating Domain
Controller as their inbound time partner.
• All Domain Controllers in a domain nominate the Primary Domain Controller
(PDC) Emulator operations master as their inbound time partner.
• All PDC Emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the
selection of their inbound time partner.
• The PDC Emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for
the organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer
to synchronize with a reliable external time server.
This vulnerability becomes much more serious if an attacker is able to change the
system time and then stop the Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize
with a time server that is not accurate.","There should be no impact, because time synchronization for most organizations should
be fully automated for all computers that belong to the domain. Computers that do not

a popular target for brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords. The value of

The Public Key Cryptography Based User-to-User (PKU2U) protocol introduced in
Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 is implemented as a security support provider
(SSP). The SSP enables peer-to-peer authentication, particularly through the Windows
7 media and file sharing feature called HomeGroup, which permits sharing between
computers that are not members of a domain.
With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package,
Spnego.dll. In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use
Kerberos or NTLM for authentication. The extension SSP for Negotiate, Negoexts.dll,
which is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs
including PKU2U.
When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs,
Negoexts.dll calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U
SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the peer computers.
When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to the
logon peer for validation and associates the user's certificate to a security token and the
logon process completes.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single
network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user
security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the
Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos
protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or
NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2
(NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients
when they perform the following operations:
• Join a domain
• Authenticate between Active Directory forests
• Authenticate to down-level domains
• Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003,

affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security
negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.
The recommended state for this setting is: Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM &
NTLM.
","Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and
NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients
only send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server
2008 (non-R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources.
However, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response -
were sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that
traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password.
The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the
Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server
2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM
protocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication
protocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the
logon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process.
Even if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and
servers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to
authenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these
reasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as
possible.","Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server
supports it; Domain Controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2
authentication). Clients that do not support NTLMv2 authentication will not be able to
authenticate in the domain and access domain resources by using LM and NTLM.","Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, you can make all types of man-in-

Note: When Windows Vista-based computers have this policy setting enabled and they

synchronized with its companion setting, Microsoft network server: Digitally sign
communications (always), on those servers. For more information about these
settings, see the ""Microsoft network client and server: Digitally sign communications
(four related settings)"" section in Chapter 5 of the Threats and Countermeasures guide.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.","Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network
as the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can
potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and
forward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the
attacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain
unauthorized access to data.
SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating

attacks and supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
SMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB,
