If password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if\nusers continually reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good\npassword policy is greatly reduced.\nIf you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the same\nsmall number of passwords repeatedly.

To address password reuse a combination of\nsecurity settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history\nsetting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords. For example, if you configure the\nEnforce password history setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 12\npasswords, they could change their password 13 times in a few minutes and reuse the\npassword they started with, unless you also configure the Minimum password age\nsetting to a number that is greater than 0.

There are many different theories about how to determine the best\npassword length for an organization, but perhaps \"passphrase\" is a better term than\n\"password.\" In Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer, passphrases can be quite long and\ncan include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as \"I want to drink a $5 milkshake\" is a\nvalid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string\nof random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated\nabout the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially around password\nlength. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length\nsetting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your\norganization's business requirements.\nThe recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s).\nNote: In Windows Server 2016 and older versions of Windows Server, the GUI of the\nLocal Security Policy (LSP), Local Group Policy Editor (LGPE) and Group Policy\nManagement Editor (GPME) would not let you set this value higher than 14 characters.\nHowever, starting with Windows Server 2019, Microsoft changed the GUI to allow up to\na 20 character minimum password length.\nNote #2: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings\n(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be\nglobally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior.

A seven-character alphabetic password with case\nsensitivity has 52 to the power of 7 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive\nalphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character\npassword has 26 to the power of 8 (or 2 x 10 to the power of 11) possible combinations.\nAlthough this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it\nwould take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords.

Microsoft MAPS / Microsoft\nDefender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service is the online community that helps you\nchoose how to respond to potential threats. The community also helps stop the spread\nof new malicious software infections. You can choose to send basic or additional\ninformation about detected software. Additional information helps Microsoft create new\ndefinitions and help it to protect your computer.\nPossible options are:\n• (0x0) Disabled (default)\n• (0x1) Basic membership\n• (0x2) Advanced membership\nBasic membership will send basic information to Microsoft about software that has\nbeen detected including where the software came from the actions that you apply or\nthat are applied automatically and whether the actions were successful.\nAdvanced membership in addition to basic information will send more information to\nMicrosoft about malicious software spyware and potentially unwanted software including\nthe location of the software file names how the software operates and how it has\nimpacted your computer.\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.",
        "Rationale": "The information that would be sent can include things like location of detected items on\nyour computer if harmful software was removed. The information would be automatically\ncollected and sent. In some instances personal information might unintentionally be sent\nto Microsoft. However, Microsoft states that it will not use this information to identify you\nor contact you.\nFor privacy reasons in high security environments, it is best to prevent these data\nsubmissions altogether.",

        "Description": "LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating\nWindows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single\nnetwork. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user\nsecurity features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the\nKerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos\nprotocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or\nNTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2\n(NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients\nwhen they perform the following operations:\n• Join a domain\n• Authenticate between Active Directory forests\n• Authenticate to down-level domains\n• Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003,\nor Windows XP\n• Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain\nThe Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which\nchallenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice\naffects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security\nnegotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM &\nNTLM.",
        "Rationale": "Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and\nNTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients\nonly send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server\n2008 (non-R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources.\nHowever, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response -\nwere sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that\ntraffic to more easily reproduce the user's password.\nThe Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the\nKerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server\n2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM\nprotocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication\nprotocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the\nlogon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process.\nEven if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and\nservers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to\nauthenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these\nreasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as\npossible.",
