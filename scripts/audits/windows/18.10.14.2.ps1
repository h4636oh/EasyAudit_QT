### Assumptions:
# - The script is designed to audit the policy setting by checking the registry. It does not perform any remediation.
# - The exit status codes are configured to return 0 for a pass and 1 for a failure, as per the requirements.
# - In the case of errors accessing the registry, the script prompts the user to manually check the setting.
