# This script checks the specified registry setting for BitLocker additional authentication at startup. It exits with a status of 0 if the value is set to 'Enabled' (represented by a registry DWORD value of 1), and exits with a status of 1 if it is not, prompting the user to manually verify and adjust the configuration via the Group Policy path provided in the instructions.
