# PowerShell 7 Script to Audit the Group Policy Setting for 'Enable features introduced via servicing that are off by default'.

# This script checks the policy setting for enabling features introduced via servicing.
# The recommended state is 'Disabled', and this is verified by checking a specific registry path.

# Define the registry path and value to check
$registryPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate"
$registryValueName = "AllowTemporaryEnterpriseFeatureControl"

# Initialize the exit code
$exitCode = 0

# Extract the registry value if it exists
try {
    $registryValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -ErrorAction Stop
    $currentValue = $registryValue.$registryValueName

    # Check if the retrieved value is 0 (which corresponds to 'Disabled')
    if ($currentValue -eq 0) {
        Write-Host "Audit Passed: The policy is correctly set to 'Disabled'."
    }
    else {
        Write-Host "Audit Failed: The policy is not set to 'Disabled'."
        $exitCode = 1
    }
}
catch {
    # Handle the case where the registry key or value might not exist
    Write-Host "Audit Failed: The registry path or value does not exist. Please set the policy manually."
    $exitCode = 1
    # Prompt the user for manual validation
    Write-Host "Manual Check Required: Please verify the Group Policy settings manually."
    Write-Host "Navigate to: 'Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Windows Update\\Manage end user experience\\Enable features introduced via servicing that are off by default'"
}

# Exit the script with the appropriate code
exit $exitCode
# ```
