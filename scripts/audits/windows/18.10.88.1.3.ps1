# PowerShell 7 script to audit if 'Disallow Digest authentication' is set to 'Enabled' for WinRM client

# Define the registry path and value to check
$registryPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Client"
$registryValueName = "AllowDigest"

# Try to get the registry value
try {
    $registryValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $registryValueName -ErrorAction Stop

    # Check if the registry value is set to 0 (Enabled)
    if ($registryValue.$registryValueName -eq 0) {
        Write-Output "Audit Passed: 'Disallow Digest authentication' is set to 'Enabled'."
        exit 0
    }
    else {
        Write-Output "Audit Failed: 'Disallow Digest authentication' is not set to 'Enabled'."
        exit 1
    }
}
catch {
    Write-Output "Audit Failed: Unable to find registry value. This might mean the setting is at its default state (Disabled)."
    exit 1
}

# Note: If the registry value is not found, it signifies the setting is at its default value, which is 'Disabled'.
# According to the requirement, the script does not take any remedial actions and is purely intended for auditing.
