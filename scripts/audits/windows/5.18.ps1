# Title: Ensure 'Problem Reports and Solutions Control Panel Support (wercplsupport)' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)
# Profile Applicability: Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)
# Description: This script audits the registry setting for the 'Problem Reports and Solutions Control Panel Support' service
# to ensure it is set to 'Disabled'. This is done by checking the Start value of the 'wercplsupport' service in the registry.

# Define the registry path and the expected value
$registryPath = 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\wercplsupport'
$registryValueName = 'Start'
$expectedValue = 4  # Disabled

# Check if the registry path exists
if (Test-Path $registryPath) {
    # Get the current value of the registry key
    $currentValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $registryValueName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

    if ($null -ne $currentValue) {
        # Check if the current value matches the expected value
        if ($currentValue.$registryValueName -eq $expectedValue) {
            Write-Output "Audit Passed: The 'Start' value of 'wercplsupport' is set to the recommended state 'Disabled'."
            exit 0
        } else {
            Write-Warning "Audit Failed: The 'Start' value of 'wercplsupport' is not set to 'Disabled'. Expected: $expectedValue, Found: $($currentValue.$registryValueName)"
            Write-Output "Please manually set the service 'Problem Reports and Solutions Control Panel Support' to 'Disabled' via Group Policy."
            exit 1
        }
    } else {
        Write-Warning "Audit Failed: Could not retrieve the 'Start' value from the registry. Please check permissions and ensure the service exists."
        exit 1
    }
} else {
    Write-Warning "Audit Failed: Registry path for 'wercplsupport' does not exist. Ensure the service is installed."
    exit 1
}
