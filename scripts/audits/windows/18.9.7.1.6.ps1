# PowerShell 7 Script to Audit the Policy Setting: "Prevent installation of devices using drivers that match these device setup classes"

# This script audits the registry to check if the device installation restriction policy is correctly set according to the specified GUIDs. It verifies the presence of each required GUID and issues a pass or fail result based on this audit. If the registry value is missing or inaccessible, it prompts the user to manually ensure the configuration via the specified Group Policy path.
