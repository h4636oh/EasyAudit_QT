### Comments:
# - The script checks if the 'Manage auditing and security log' user right is correctly assigned to the Administrators group.
# - The SID `S-1-5-32-544` is used to identify the Administrators group.
# - If the audit passes, the script exits with status code 0; if it fails, it exits with status 1.
# - In case of failure, it prompts the user to manually verify and configure the setting through Group Policy Management.
