# This script audits the specified registry setting to ensure the policy "Security: Control Event Log behavior when the log file reaches its maximum size" is set to "Disabled" as indicated by a registry value of `0`. If the registry path or value does not exist, or if the value is not as expected, the script provides informative output and exits with a status of 1 to indicate an audit failure. Otherwise, it confirms the setting is correct and exits with a status of 0.
