# PowerShell 7 Script to Audit BitLocker Policy Setting
# This script checks if the 'Choose how BitLocker-protected operating system drives can be recovered:
# Save BitLocker recovery information to AD DS for operating system drives' is set to 'Enabled: True'

# Registry path and value to check
$registryPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"
$registryValueName = "OSActiveDirectoryBackup"
$desiredValue = 1

            $currentValue = (Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $registryValueName).$registryValueName

            # Compare the current value with the desired value

# Run the audit function
Audit-BitLockerPolicy
# ```
# 
# // Note:
# // - This script audits the registry setting for BitLocker to ensure the policy is configured to save recovery information to AD DS.
# // - It does not make any changes to the system and is purely for auditing purposes, as per the requirement.
