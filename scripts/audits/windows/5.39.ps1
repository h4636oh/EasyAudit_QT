# PowerShell 7 Script for Auditing WinRM Service Status
# This script checks if Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is set to 'Disabled' 
# according to the specified registry setting. It is meant solely for audit purposes.

# Define the registry path and name
$registryPath = 'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\WinRM'
$registryName = 'Start'

# Try to get the registry value
try {
    $winrmStatus = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $registryName -ErrorAction Stop
} catch {
    Write-Output "Failed to retrieve WinRM service status from the registry."
    exit 1
}

# Check if the WinRM Start value is set to the recommended state '4' (Disabled)
if ($winrmStatus.Start -eq 4) {
    Write-Output "Audit passed: Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is set to 'Disabled'."
    exit 0
} else {
    Write-Output "Audit failed: Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is not set to 'Disabled'."
    Write-Output "Manual check required. Please verify the following path in Group Policy:"
    Write-Output "Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\System Services\\Windows Remote Management (WS-Management)"
    exit 1
}
