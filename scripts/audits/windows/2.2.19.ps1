# This script audits the "Deny log on locally" policy setting to ensure it includes "Guests" as specified in the requirements. If the setting is correct, it exits with a success code (0). If the setting is incorrect or cannot be verified, it prompts the user to manually check the configuration and exits with a failure code (1).
