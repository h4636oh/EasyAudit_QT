# Objective: Audit the 'Audit Detailed File Share' policy to ensure it is set to include 'Failure'

# Function to check the current audit policy setting for 'Detailed File Share'
function Get-AuditPolicySetting {
    # Executing auditpol command to retrieve the current settings for Detailed File Share
    $auditPolicy = auditpol /get /subcategory:"Detailed File Share" | Select-String "Failure" 

    # Check if the setting includes 'Failure'
    if ($auditPolicy) {
        Write-Output "Audit Policy is correctly set to include 'Failure'."
        return $true
    } else {
        Write-Output "Audit Policy is NOT set to include 'Failure'. Please configure it manually."
        return $false
    }
}

# Execute the auditing and capture the result
$result = Get-AuditPolicySetting

# Exit the script based on the audit result
if ($result) {
    exit 0 # Success
} else {
    exit 1 # Failure
}
# ```
# 
# - The script checks the current audit policy setting for "Detailed File Share".
# - It uses `auditpol /get` command and looks for the word "Failure" to determine if the audit policy is configured correctly.
# - If the policy is set correctly, it outputs a success message and exits with `0`.
# - If the policy is not set correctly, it prompts the user to configure it manually and exits with `1`.
# - The script strictly adheres to auditing without making any configurations or changes.
