# PowerShell 7 Script to Audit TCP KeepAliveTime Setting
# Ensure 'MSS: (KeepAliveTime) How often keep-alive packets are sent in milliseconds' is set to 'Enabled: 300,000 or 5 minutes'

# Registry path and value parameters for the audit
$registryPath = "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters"
$registryValueName = "KeepAliveTime"
$expectedValue = 300000

# Attempt to read the registry value
try {
    $keepAliveTime = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $registryValueName -ErrorAction Stop
} catch {
    Write-Output "Audit failed: Unable to read registry value. Please ensure access rights and correct path."
    Exit 1
}

# Compare the retrieved value with the expected value
if ($keepAliveTime.$registryValueName -eq $expectedValue) {
    Write-Output "Audit passed: KeepAliveTime is set to the recommended value ($expectedValue milliseconds)."
    Exit 0
} else {
    Write-Output "Audit failed: KeepAliveTime is set to $($keepAliveTime.$registryValueName) milliseconds. It should be set to $expectedValue milliseconds."
    Write-Output "Please manually configure it via Group Policy as described in the remediation section."
    Exit 1
}
# ```

# This script checks if the `KeepAliveTime` value is set correctly in the registry under the specified path. If the value matches the expected `300,000` milliseconds, it outputs a success message and exits with status code `0`. If not, it outputs a failure message and advises manual configuration, exiting with status code `1`.
