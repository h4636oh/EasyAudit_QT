# In this script, we check a specific registry key to ensure that 'Point and Print Restrictions' is set to 'Enabled: Show warning and elevation prompt'. If the key is not found or set incorrectly, the script outputs an audit failure message and exits with a status code of 1. If the setting is correct, it outputs a success message and exits with a status code of 0.
