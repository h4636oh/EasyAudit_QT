# PowerShell script to audit 'Allow Cloud Search' policy setting

# This script checks if the "AllowCloudSearch" registry key exists and, if so, whether its value is set to `0`, indicating that cloud search is disabled. If the registry setting is compliant (either the key's value is `0` or the key does not exist), the script exits successfully with code `0`. If it is non-compliant, it exits with code `1`. The script prompts for manual verification if the conditions aren't met.
