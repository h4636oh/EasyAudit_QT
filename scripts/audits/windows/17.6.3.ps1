# This script checks if the 'Audit Other Object Access Events' setting is set to 'Success and Failure'. It queries this setting using `auditpol`, a command-line tool for managing and querying auditing policies. If the current setting is as recommended, the script exits with a status code `0`, otherwise, it prompts the user to ensure the correct settings are applied manually and exits with a status code `1`.
