# This script is designed to audit whether the "Kernel-mode Hardware-enforced Stack Protection" setting is enabled as recommended. It checks the corresponding registry key and value to determine compliance. If the configuration does not meet the expectation, it provides an appropriate message and exits with code `1`. The script also reminds the user to manually ensure that the system's hardware and software configurations comply with the prerequisites outlined in the audit description.
