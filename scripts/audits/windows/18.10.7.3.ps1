# Script to audit the "Turn off Autoplay" Group Policy setting.
# This script checks if the registry value is set according to the recommended policy.

$registryName = 'NoDriveTypeAutoRun'

        exit 0
    } else {
        # Audit Fails
        Write-Host "Audit Failed: 'Turn off Autoplay' is NOT set to 'Enabled: All drives'. Expected value is $expectedValue but found $($currentValue.$registryName). Please update your Group Policy settings."
        exit 1
    }
} else {
    # Handle the case where the registry key is not found
    Write-Host "Audit Failed: Unable to find 'NoDriveTypeAutoRun' in the registry. This typically indicates that the Group Policy has not been set. Please check your settings."
    exit 1
}

# 
# In this script, we verify if the `NoDriveTypeAutoRun` registry value under the specified path is set to `255`, which indicates that Autoplay is turned off for all drives. If this value is set as expected, the audit passes; otherwise, it fails, prompting the user to check and manually set the Group Policy according to the requirements.
