# 
### Explanation
# - The script checks the current assignment of the "Debug programs" user right.
# - This is done by exporting the local security policy to a temporary file and then parsing it to find the `SeDebugPrivilege`.
# - Compares the found assignments with the expected assignment (`Administrators`).
# - Outputs the result of the audit and exits with code 0 if it passes, or 1 if it fails.
# - During failure, it prompts for manual UI-based verification, adhering to the script's auditing purpose only.
