### Explanation:
# - The script defines the function `Audit-ProfileSingleProcess` to audit the "Profile single process" user rights assignment.
# - It checks if the user right is assigned to "Administrators", which is the expected value as per the input.
# - If the setting cannot be retrieved, a message prompts the user to verify the setting manually.
# - Based on the audit result, the script exits with code 0 for success and 1 for failure.
