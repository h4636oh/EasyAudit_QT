# PowerShell 7 Script to Audit the Guest Account Renaming Configuration
# This script checks if the built-in local guest account has been renamed.
# The audit is based on the configuration settings as detailed in the provided guidelines.

try {
    # Define the expected account name that indicates the Guest account has been renamed
    $expectedRenamedAccount = 'SomethingOtherThanGuest'  # Placeholder, replace with the actual expected name
    
    # Get the current name of the Guest account
    $guestAccountSID = (Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Account -Filter "Domain='$env:COMPUTERNAME' AND Name='Guest'").SID
    $accountName = (Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Account | Where-Object { $_.SID -eq $guestAccountSID }).Name

    if ($null -eq $accountName) {
        # If accountName is not found, prompt the user to verify manually
        Write-Host "The Guest account may have been deleted or renamed to an unidentifiable name."
    } elseif ($accountName -ne $expectedRenamedAccount) {
        Write-Host "Audit Failed: The guest account has not been renamed as recommended."
        Write-Host "Please manually verify and rename the Guest account following the UI path:"
        Write-Host "Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options > Accounts: Rename guest account"
        exit 1
    } else {
        Write-Host "Audit Passed: The guest account is correctly renamed."
        exit 0
    }
} catch {
    Write-Host "An error occurred during the audit process. Please check the configuration manually."
