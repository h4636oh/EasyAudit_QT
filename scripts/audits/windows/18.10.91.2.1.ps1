# PowerShell 7 script to audit the policy setting for
# 'Prevent users from modifying settings' in the Exploit protection settings.

# Define the registry path and value to check
$regPath = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender Security Center\App and Browser protection'
$regName = 'DisallowExploitProtectionOverride'

# Try to get the value from the registry
try {
    $regValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name $regName -ErrorAction Stop
    if ($regValue.$regName -eq 1) {
        Write-Output "Audit Passed: 'Prevent users from modifying settings' is ENABLED as recommended."

    } else {
        Write-Output "Audit Failed: 'Prevent users from modifying settings' is NOT ENABLED."
        exit 1
    }
} catch {
    Write-Warning "Audit Failed: Unable to retrieve the setting. It may not be configured."
    exit 1
}

# Note: If the registry path or value does not exist, it indicates the setting is either not configured or set to Default (Disabled).
# Instructions to manually verify the setting:
Write-Host "Please verify manually: Navigate to 'Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> Windows Security -> App and browser protection -> Prevent users from modifying settings' and ensure it is set to 'Enabled'."
