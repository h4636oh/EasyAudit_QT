# PowerShell 7 Script for Auditing BitLocker Policy Setting
# This script audits the 'Prevent installation of devices using drivers that match these device setup classes' setting.
# It checks if the corresponding registry key is set, indicating that the policy is enabled.
# Exits with code 0 if the audit passes (enabled), or 1 if it fails (not enabled or not configured).

# Define the registry path and value pair to audit
$registryPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceInstall\Restrictions"
$registryValueName = "DenyDeviceClasses"
$expectedValue = 1

# Check if the registry key exists and its value
$registryValueExists = Test-Path -Path "$registryPath\$registryValueName"

if ($registryValueExists) {
    $actualValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $registryValueName | Select-Object -ExpandProperty $registryValueName
    
    if ($actualValue -eq $expectedValue) {
        Write-Host "Audit Passed: The policy setting is correctly enabled in the registry."
        exit 0
    }
    else {
        Write-Host "Audit Failed: The policy setting is not set to the expected value in the registry."
        exit 1
    }
}
else {
    Write-Host "Audit Failed: The registry key for the policy setting does not exist."
    exit 1
}

# Prompt the user for manual verification in the UI if the registry key does not exist or its value is incorrect
Write-Host "Please manually verify the group policy setting via the following UI path:"
Write-Host "Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > System > Device Installation > Device Installation Restrictions > Prevent installation of devices using drivers that match these device setup classes"
