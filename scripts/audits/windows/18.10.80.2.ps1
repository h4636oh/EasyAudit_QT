# PowerShell 7 script to audit the Windows Installer privilege setting

# Define the registry path and key
$registryPath = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer'
$registryKey = 'AlwaysInstallElevated'

# Try to get the registry value
try {
    $regValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $registryKey -ErrorAction Stop
    
    # Check the value of the registry key
    if ($regValue.$registryKey -eq 0) {
        Write-Output "Audit Passed: The 'Always install with elevated privileges' setting is Disabled."
        exit 0
    }
    else {
        Write-Warning "Audit Failed: The 'Always install with elevated privileges' setting is Enabled. "
        Write-Warning "Please manually set the Group Policy 'Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Windows Installer\\Always install with elevated privileges' to 'Disabled'."
        exit 1
    }
}
catch {
    Write-Warning "Audit Failed: Unable to retrieve registry value. The 'Always install with elevated privileges' setting might not be configured."
    Write-Warning "Please manually check and set the Group Policy 'Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Windows Installer\\Always install with elevated privileges' to 'Disabled'."

# This script checks the registry setting for "AlwaysInstallElevated" under the specified path. If the registry value is set to `0`, the audit passes, meaning the security setting is correctly configured. If the value is not `0`, it warns the user to manually check and set the Group Policy as required. The script uses exit codes (`0` for pass and `1` for fail) to indicate the audit result.
