# PowerShell script to audit the status of the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Locator service
# The script checks if the service is set to Disabled (Start value of 4 in the registry).
# It exits with code 0 if the audit passes and with code 1 if it fails.

# This script checks the registry to confirm if the 'Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Locator' service is disabled by verifying that the `Start` value is set to 4. If the condition is not met, it prompts the user to adjust the Group Policy manually. The script exits with `0` if the service is correctly configured, and `1` if not, as required.
