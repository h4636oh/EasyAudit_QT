# PowerShell 7 script to audit the registry setting for 'Prevent Internet Explorer security prompt for Windows Installer scripts'
# This script checks if the setting is 'Disabled' as per the security recommendation.
# Exit 0 for success (passes the audit), Exit 1 for failure (fails the audit).

# Registry path for the policy
$registryPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer"
# The expected registry value name
$registryValueName = "SafeForScripting"
# The expected value for 'Disabled' state
$expectedValue = 0

# Try to get the current registry value
try {
    $actualValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $registryValueName -ErrorAction Stop
    if ($actualValue.$registryValueName -eq $expectedValue) {
        Write-Host "Audit Successful: The registry value is correctly set to 'Disabled'."
        exit 0
    } else {
        Write-Host "Audit Failed: The registry value is not set to 'Disabled'. Expected: $expectedValue, Found: $($actualValue.$registryValueName)"
        exit 1

    Write-Host "Audit Failed: Could not retrieve the registry setting. Please check manually."
