# - In a real scenario, replace `Get-SeUserRightsAssignment` with the appropriate cmdlet or method to retrieve the user rights assignment on your system. You may need admin privileges to execute certain operations.
# - This script provides an audit and will prompt necessary manual verification or correction when needed.
# - Adjustments may be needed based on the environment specifics or if the method to get user rights assignments differs.
