# This script checks the registry key `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE` for the `RDVRecoveryPassword` value and verifies if it is set to `0`, which aligns with the policy setting of "Do not allow 48-digit recovery password". It outputs an appropriate message and exits with a specific code based on the audit result. If the registry entry is not found, the script suggests that the user should ensure the policy is set manually according to the given remediation steps.
