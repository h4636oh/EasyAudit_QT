# This script audits the Windows Firewall setting to ensure that the "Display a notification"
# option for the Public profile is set to 'No'. The script checks the registry value to determine the setting
# and outputs the result. It adheres to PowerShell 7 syntax and best practices.

# Define the registry path and value name
$registryPath = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PublicProfile'
$valueName = 'DisableNotifications'

# Try to read the registry value
try {
    $registryValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $valueName -ErrorAction Stop
} catch {
    Write-Host "Audit Failed: Unable to read the registry path or value. Please check if the registry path is correct and accessible."
    exit 1
}

# Check if the DisableNotifications is set to 1
if ($registryValue.$valueName -eq 1) {
    Write-Host "Audit Passed: Notifications are disabled as expected."
    exit 0
} else {
    Write-Host "Audit Failed: Notifications are not disabled. Please set 'Display a notification' to 'No' in GPO."
