            exit 1
        }
    } else {
        Write-Output "Audit failed: Registry path '$registryPath' does not exist. Please confirm the Group Policy is applied correctly."
        exit 1

# This script audits the "Configure Solicited Remote Assistance" setting by checking the specified registry value. If the current value equals the expected value (0), the audit passes. Otherwise, it prompts the user to manually review the Group Policy. Any errors during the process will result in a failed audit indicating a potential issue.
