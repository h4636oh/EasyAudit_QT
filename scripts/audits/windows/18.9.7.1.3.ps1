# PowerShell 7 script to audit the policy setting for preventing installation of devices that match specified device IDs

# Define the registry path and value name we need to audit
$registryPath = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceInstall\Restrictions'
$valueName = 'DenyDeviceIDsRetroactive'

try {
    # Check if the registry key exists
    $registryKey = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -ErrorAction Stop

    # Retrieve the value and check if it's set to 1 (enabled)
    $isPolicyEnabled = ($registryKey.$valueName -eq 1)

    if ($isPolicyEnabled) {
        Write-Host "Audit Passed: The policy 'Prevent installation of devices that match any of these device IDs' is enabled and set correctly." -ForegroundColor Green
        exit 0
    } else {
        Write-Host "Audit Failed: The policy is not set correctly. Manual action required to enable it." -ForegroundColor Red
        exit 1
    }

} catch {
    Write-Host "Audit Failed: Could not retrieve the policy setting. Manual action required to verify configuration." -ForegroundColor Red
    Write-Host "Please check the registry key: $registryPath and ensure '$valueName' is set to 1." -ForegroundColor Yellow
    exit 1
}

# Note: The script checks if the policy is enabled by confirming the registry value is set to 1.
# It prompts the user to manually verify and configure the setting through the Group Policy if it is not set.
