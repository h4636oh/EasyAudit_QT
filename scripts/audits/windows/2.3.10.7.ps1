# The script checks the registry configuration for the 'Network access: Remotely accessible registry paths' setting. If the paths configured in the registry do not match the recommended ones, it will output the differences and exit with status 1. If the registry paths are correctly configured, it will output a confirmation message and exit with status 0. In case of any error accessing the registry, an error message will be displayed, and the script will exit with status 1.
