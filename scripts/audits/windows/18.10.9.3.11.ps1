# This PowerShell script audits the configuration of the BitLocker setting for removable data drives to ensure it is set to 'Disabled' by checking the relevant registry key. If the registry value does not match the expected setting, it outputs instructions for manual verification and sets the exit code accordingly. It adheres to the requirement of not making any changes, only auditing existing settings.
