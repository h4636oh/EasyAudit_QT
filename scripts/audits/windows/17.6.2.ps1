#```powershell
# This script audits the 'Audit File Share' policy setting to ensure it is set to 'Success and Failure'
# as per the recommended state for enterprise environments.

# Define the category and subcategory for checking the audit policy
$Subcategory = "File Share"

try {
    # Get the current audit policy setting for 'File Share'
    $auditPolicy = & auditpol.exe /get /subcategory:"$Subcategory"

    # Check if the 'Audit File Share' setting includes both 'Success' and 'Failure'
    if ($auditPolicy -match "Success\s+Failure") {
        Write-Host "Audit Policy for 'File Share' is correctly set to 'Success and Failure'."
        exit 0
    } else {
        Write-Host "Audit Policy for 'File Share' is NOT set to 'Success and Failure'. Please configure it manually."
        exit 1
    }
} catch {

    exit 1
}
# ```
# 
# This PowerShell script checks if the "Audit File Share" policy is set to "Success and Failure" using `auditpol.exe`. If it is set correctly, the script exits with status 0; otherwise, it prompts the user to configure it manually and exits with status 1. The script handles exceptions gracefully to ensure robust auditing.
