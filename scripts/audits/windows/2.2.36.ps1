### Notes:
# - This script checks the "Replace a process level token" setting against the expected users 'LOCAL SERVICE' and 'NETWORK SERVICE'.
# - Due to limitations in inspecting specific Windows policies via PowerShell cmdlets directly (like user rights), the script uses a placeholder to demonstrate intent.
# - In actual environments lacking specific cmdlets, adjunct manual verification steps may be necessary, and the script prompts for such actions.
# - Improper group retrieval logic is adjusted assuming a method of checking group members which might require custom implementation due to unavailable direct mapping, hence `Get-LocalGroupMember` as a placeholder in the script. Adjust according to specific environment tools available.
# - The script exits with code `0` for success and `1` for failure as specified.
