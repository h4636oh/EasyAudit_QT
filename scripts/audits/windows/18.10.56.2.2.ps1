# PowerShell 7 Script to Audit Cloud Clipboard Integration Setting
# Ensures 'Disable Cloud Clipboard integration for server-to-client data transfer' is set to 'Enabled'

# Define the registry path and value name
$registryPath = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services\Client'
$valueName = 'DisableCloudClipboardIntegration'

try {
    # Get the current value of the registry entry
    $currentValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $valueName -ErrorAction Stop

    # Check if the registry value is set to 1 (Enabled)
    if ($currentValue.$valueName -eq 1) {
        Write-Output "Audit Passed: 'Disable Cloud Clipboard Integration' is set to 'Enabled'."
        exit 0
    }
    else {
        Write-Output "Audit Failed: 'Disable Cloud Clipboard Integration' is NOT set to 'Enabled'. Please verify manually via Group Policy."
        exit 1
    }
}
catch {
    # Handle case where registry path or value does not exist
    Write-Output "Audit Failed: Unable to find the registry path or value. Please verify manually via Group Policy."
    exit 1
}
# ```

# This script checks a specific registry setting to ensure that the 'Disable Cloud Clipboard Integration for server-to-client data transfer' policy is enabled, which corresponds to a registry value of 1. If the setting is as expected, it outputs that the audit has passed; otherwise, it prompts the user to verify the configuration manually. The script exits with a status code of 0 for a pass and 1 for a failure.
