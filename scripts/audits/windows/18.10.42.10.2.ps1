# PowerShell 7 Script to Audit Microsoft Defender Antivirus Real-Time Protection Setting

# Define the registry path and value name to check
$registryPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Real-Time Protection"
$valueName = "DisableRealtimeMonitoring"
$desiredValue = 0

# Try to get the registry value
try {
    $regValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $valueName -ErrorAction Stop
} catch {
    Write-Output "Error accessing registry path: $registryPath"
    Write-Output "Ensure the registry path is accessible and try again."
    exit 1
}

# Check if the actual registry value matches the desired value
if ($regValue.$valueName -eq $desiredValue) {
    Write-Output "Audit Passed: 'Turn off real-time protection' is set to 'Disabled'."
    exit 0
} else {
    Write-Output "Audit Failed: 'Turn off real-time protection' is not set to 'Disabled'."
    Write-Output "Please navigate to the appropriate Group Policy or registry setting to verify manually."
    exit 1
}

# This script audits the "Turn off real-time protection" setting in Microsoft Defender Antivirus. It checks whether the registry value for `DisableRealtimeMonitoring` is set to `0`, which means the setting is 'Disabled' as required. The script provides guidance if manual intervention is necessary.
