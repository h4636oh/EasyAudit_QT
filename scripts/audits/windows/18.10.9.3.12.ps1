# This script conducts an audit to verify whether smart cards can be used for authenticating user access to BitLocker-protected removable data drives, which is backed by a registry setting. The script checks the specified registry entry and verifies its state. If the required policy setting is correctly enabled, the script exits with a pass status. Otherwise, it delivers a fail status and prompts for manual verification where necessary.
