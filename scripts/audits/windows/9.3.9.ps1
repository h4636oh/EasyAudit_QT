# Description: This script checks if the Windows Firewall setting for logging successful connections is enabled.

# Define the registry path and value name
$registryPath = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PublicProfile\Logging'
$valueName = 'LogSuccessfulConnections'

# Try to get the registry value
try {
    $regValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $valueName -ErrorAction Stop
} catch {
    Write-Host "The registry path or value could not be found. Please ensure the group policy is applied."
    # Exit with status code 1 indicating audit failure
    exit 1
}

# Check if the registry value is set to 1 (meaning logging is enabled)
if ($regValue.$valueName -eq 1) {
    Write-Host "Audit Passed: Windows Firewall logging for successful connections is enabled."
    # Exit with status code 0 indicating audit pass
    exit 0
} else {
    Write-Host "Audit Failed: Windows Firewall logging for successful connections is not enabled."
    Write-Host "Please manually configure the setting as follows:"
    Write-Host "Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Windows Defender Firewall -> Windows Firewall Properties -> Public Profile -> Logging -> Customize -> Log successful connections"
    # Exit with status code 1 indicating audit failure
