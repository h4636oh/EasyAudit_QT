# PowerShell 7 script to audit the 'Enable Windows NTP Client' setting.

# Define the registry path and key for the NTP Client setting
$registryPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpClient"

# Function to check if the Windows NTP Client is enabled

# Main script logic

if (Test-NtpClientEnabled) {
    # If audit passes, exit with code 0
    exit 0
} else {
    # If audit fails, exit with code 1
    exit 1
}
# ```

# This script assesses whether the Windows NTP Client is enabled by examining a specific registry key. It informs the user of the audit status, guiding them to manual verification if needed, and exits with the appropriate status code.
