# This PowerShell 7 script audits the registry entry for the `LxssManager` service to ensure that its `Start` value is set to `4` (Disabled) or the service is not installed. If the audit fails, it provides a prompt for manual verification. The script exits with code `0` if the audit passes and `1` if it fails.
