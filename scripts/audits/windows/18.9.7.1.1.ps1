# PowerShell 7 Script for Auditing Group Policy 'Prevent installation of devices that match any of these device IDs'
# The script verifies the registry value to ensure the policy is enabled.

# Define the registry path and value name
$registryPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceInstall\Restrictions"
$valueName = "DenyDeviceIDs"
$expectedValue = 1

try {
    # Check if the registry key exists
    if (Test-Path $registryPath) {
        # Get the current registry value
        $currentValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $valueName -ErrorAction Stop | Select-Object -ExpandProperty $valueName

        # Compare the current value with the expected value
        if ($currentValue -eq $expectedValue) {
            Write-Host "Audit Passed: The policy 'Prevent installation of devices that match any of these device IDs' is set to 'Enabled'."
            exit 0
        } else {
            Write-Host "Audit Failed: The policy 'Prevent installation of devices that match any of these device IDs' is NOT set to 'Enabled'. Current value: $currentValue"
            exit 1
        }
    } else {
        Write-Host "Audit Failed: The registry path '$registryPath' does not exist."
        exit 1

} catch {
    Write-Host "Audit Failed: An error occurred - $_"
    exit 1
}

Write-Host "Please ensure that the Group Policy 'Prevent installation of devices that match any of these device IDs' is set to 'Enabled'."
exit 1

# This script checks the registry setting corresponding to the Group Policy and exits with status 0 if the policy is set to 'Enabled' (i.e., the registry value is 1). If the setting is not enabled, it prompts the user to ensure the correct Group Policy is applied and exits with status 1.
