# PowerShell 7 script to audit the Windows Firewall log file path for the Private Profile
# as prescribed in the audit requirements.
# The objective is to ensure it is set to '%SystemRoot%\System32\logfiles\firewall\privatefw.log'

# Define the recommended log file path
$recommendedPath = "$env:SystemRoot\System32\logfiles\firewall\privatefw.log"

# Define the registry path and value name for the audit
$registryPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PrivateProfile\Logging"
$valueName = "LogFilePath"

# Attempt to get the log file path from the registry
try {
    $currentLogFilePath = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $valueName -ErrorAction Stop
} catch {
    Write-Host "Error accessing registry path: $registryPath" -ForegroundColor Red
    Write-Host "Please ensure the registry key exists or create it manually as prescribed."
    exit 1
}

# Compare the current log file path with the recommended path
if ($currentLogFilePath.LogFilePath -eq $recommendedPath) {
    Write-Host "Audit Passed: The log file path is correctly set to: $recommendedPath" -ForegroundColor Green
    exit 0
} else {
    Write-Host "Audit Failed: The current log file path ($currentLogFilePath.LogFilePath) is not set to the recommended path ($recommendedPath)." -ForegroundColor Yellow
    Write-Host "Please set it manually as directed in the remediation section of the policy."
    exit 1
}
