# This script checks if the specified registry value is set to the recommended configuration (a DWORD value of 0 at the given registry path). If the registry key or value does not exist, or if the value is incorrect, the script prompts the user to make the change manually through the Group Policy editor. The script exits with a status of 0 if the audit passes and 1 if it fails.
