# Please note:
# - Replace `[USER SID]` with the actual SID of the user whose settings you want to audit.
# - This script audits the configuration but does not apply any changes. It prompts for manual remediation if the audit fails.
# - The script exits with code `0` if the audit passes and `1` if it fails, as required.
