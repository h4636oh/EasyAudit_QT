# PowerShell 7 Script to Audit 'Access this computer from the network' User Right

# The script will check if the user right 'Access this computer from the network' is set to 'Administrators, Remote Desktop Users'
# If the setting matches the recommended configuration, the script will exit with code 0 (pass).
# If the setting does not match, it will prompt the user to manually verify the settings and exit with code 1 (fail).

# Define the expected user rights
$expectedUserRights = @('Administrators', 'Remote Desktop Users')

try {
    # Retrieve the current user rights for 'Access this computer from the network'
    $currentUserRights = (Get-LocalGroupPolicy -Name 'Access this computer from the network').UserRights

    # Compare the current user rights with the expected user rights
    if ($currentUserRights -eq $null) {
        Write-Host "Unable to retrieve the current user rights. Please ensure the script has the necessary permissions."
        exit 1
    }

    if ($currentUserRights -contains $expectedUserRights) {
        Write-Host "Audit Passed: 'Access this computer from the network' is set to the expected value."
        exit 0
    }
    else {
        Write-Host "Audit Failed: 'Access this computer from the network' is not set correctly."
        Write-Host "Current User Rights: $currentUserRights"
        Write-Host "Please manually verify the setting under:"
        Write-Host "Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment\Access this computer from the network"
        exit 1
    }
}
catch {
    Write-Host "An error occurred during the audit: $_"
    exit 1
}
# ```

### Comments:
# 1. **Assumptions**: The script assumes a function `Get-LocalGroupPolicy` is available to retrieve the group policy settings, which is not natively available in PowerShell. This should be replaced with the appropriate method to retrieve user rights assignments if it doesn't exist or provide a custom function or cmdlet capable of this action.
# 2. **Prompt for Manual Action**: If the audit fails, the script prompts the user to verify the settings manually following the specified path.
# 3. **Exit Codes**: The script exits with code 0 if the audit passes and 1 if it fails, as per the requirement.
