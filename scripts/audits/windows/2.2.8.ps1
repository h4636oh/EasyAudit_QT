### Comments
# - This script assumes the use of `Get-LocalGroupPolicy`, a placeholder for gathering local policy assignments. In a real-world scenario, replace this with the appropriate method to query user rights assignments.
# - The script checks for both 'Administrators' and 'LOCAL SERVICE' in the list of users/groups assigned the right to change the system time.
# - Exit codes are used to indicate the success (`exit 0`) or failure (`exit 1`) of the audit.
# - It prompts the user for manual verification if the audit fails, providing instructions on where to check within the Group Policy management console.
