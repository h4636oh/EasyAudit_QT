# PowerShell 7 Script to Audit "Perform volume maintenance tasks" Policy Setting

# This script audits the "Perform volume maintenance tasks" user right assignment
# The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.

# Define the required user right and group
$requiredUserRight = "SeManageVolumePrivilege"
$requiredGroup = "Administrators"
$auditPass = $false

# Function to check the user right assignment
function Check-UserRightAssignment {
    param (
        [string]$right,
        [string]$group
    )
    try {
        # Retrieve the current users assigned to the specified user right
        $assignedUsers = (Get-LocalUserRight -Right $right).Account

        # Check if the required group is present in the assigned users
        if ($assignedUsers -contains $group) {
            Write-Output "Audit Passed: '$right' is assigned to '$group'."
            return $true
        }
        else {
            Write-Output "Audit Failed: '$right' is not assigned to '$group'."
            return $false
        }
    } catch {
        Write-Output "Error occurred while checking user rights: $_"
        return $false
    }
}

# Conduct the audit
$auditPass = Check-UserRightAssignment -right $requiredUserRight -group $requiredGroup

# Print message to navigate to UI path for manual check if needed
Write-Output "Please ensure to manually verify the setting using the following UI path:"
Write-Output "Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\User Rights Assignment\\Perform volume maintenance tasks"

# Exit with appropriate code based on the audit results
if ($auditPass) {
    exit 0
} else {
    exit 1
}
# ```
# 
# Note: The PowerShell command `Get-LocalUserRight` used in this script assumes there exists a function or module capable of retrieving local user rights assignments. If such a command is not available, the script would need to be adapted with an appropriate alternative method or revert to another tool for gathering such system information manually or through another process. The manual verification prompt is included per the requirement to check the setting manually through the provided UI path.
