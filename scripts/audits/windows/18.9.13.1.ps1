        $regValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name $regName -ErrorAction Stop
        if ($regValue.$regName -eq $requiredValue) {
            Write-Host "Audit passed: The Boot-Start Driver Initialization Policy is set correctly."
            exit 0
        } else {
            Write-Host "Audit failed: The Boot-Start Driver Initialization Policy is not set to the required value."
            exit 1
        }
    } catch {
        Write-Host "Audit failed: Unable to retrieve the registry value. Ensure the policy is applied via Group Policy."
        exit 1
    }
}

# Prompt the user to manually verify the Group Policy setting if necessary
Write-Host "Please ensure that the following Group Policy is configured manually:"
Write-Host "'Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Administrative Templates -> System -> Early Launch Antimalware -> Boot-Start Driver Initialization Policy'"
Write-Host "It should be set to 'Enabled: Good, unknown and bad but critical'."

# Execute the registry value check function
