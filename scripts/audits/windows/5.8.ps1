# This script audits whether the "Link-Layer Topology Discovery Mapper (lltdsvc)" service is set to "Disabled" by checking the corresponding registry setting. The script will exit with a code 0 if the audit passes (indicating the required state is configured) and with code 1 if it fails. If the registry path does not exist or an error occurs while accessing the registry, it will notify the user and exit with code 1.
