# PowerShell 7 Script to audit the policy setting for "Deny access to this computer from the network"
# The script checks if 'Guests' is included in this policy to ensure compliance with the recommended state.

# Define the expected state
$expectedUsers = @('Guests')

# Initialize the fail flag
$auditFailed = $false

# Function to get the current policy value
function Get-DenyAccessFromNetworkPolicy {
    try {
        # Retrieve the current policy setting from the local security policy
        $policy = Get-Content 'c:\Windows\Security\database\secedit.sdb' | Select-String "Deny access to this computer from the network"
        return $policy
    } catch {
        Write-Error "Failed to read the policy setting. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the security database."
        return $null
    }
}

# Get the current policy configuration
$currentPolicy = Get-DenyAccessFromNetworkPolicy

# Validate if the current policy matches the expected configuration
if ($null -eq $currentPolicy) {
    $auditFailed = $true
} else {
    foreach ($user in $expectedUsers) {
        if ($currentPolicy -notmatch $user) {
            $auditFailed = $true
            Write-Host "Audit Failed: $user is not included in the 'Deny access to this computer from the network' policy."
        }
    }
}

# Prompt the user for manual verification if the audit result is inconclusive
if ($auditFailed) {
    Write-Host "Please manually verify the setting: Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Local Policies -> User Rights Assignment -> Deny access to this computer from the network."
    exit 1
} else {
    Write-Host "Audit Passed: The policy includes 'Guests' as expected."
    exit 0
}
# ```

### Comments:
# 
# - The script audits the local security policy to ensure 'Guests' are included in the "Deny access to this computer from the network" policy setting.
# - If it fails to verify the policy (e.g., due to unable to read the policy setting), it flags the audit as failed and prompts the user for manual verification.
# - The script exits with status `1` if the audit fails and `0` if it passes.
# - Error handling is implemented to notify if there is an issue accessing the policy settings.
# - The script assumes that the security database is located at `c:\Windows\Security\database\secedit.sdb`. Modify the path as necessary per your environment's setup.
