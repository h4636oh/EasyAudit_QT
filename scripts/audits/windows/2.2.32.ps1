### Comments
# - This script attempts to audit the 'Modify firmware environment values' setting by checking if the `SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege` is assigned to the Administrators group.
# - It uses `Get-SeLocalUserRightsAssignment` in a conceptual manner that represents fetching user rights, which varies depending on the tools available in your environment or how they are implemented.
# - Users need to validate the existence of any execution-specific cmdlet like `Get-SeLocalUserRightsAssignment`.
