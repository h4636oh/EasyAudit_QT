# The script checks if the 'User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for standard users'
# is set to 'Automatically deny elevation requests' and exits with appropriate status.
# Exit status: 0 for pass, 1 for fail

# Define the registry path and value name
$registryPath = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System'
$valueName = 'ConsentPromptBehaviorUser'
$expectedValue = 0

# Try to retrieve the registry value
try {
    $actualValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $valueName -ErrorAction Stop
} catch {
    Write-Host "Error retrieving registry value. Please ensure you have appropriate permissions to access the registry."
    Exit 1
}

# Check if the actual value matches the expected value
if ($actualValue.$valueName -eq $expectedValue) {
    Write-Host "Audit passed: 'User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for standard users' is set correctly."
    Exit 0
} else {
    Write-Host "Audit failed: 'User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for standard users' is NOT set to 'Automatically deny elevation requests'."
    Write-Host "Please navigate to Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options and set 'User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for standard users' to 'Automatically deny elevation requests'."
