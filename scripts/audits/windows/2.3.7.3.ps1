# PowerShell 7 Script to Audit Machine Account Lockout Threshold for BitLocker

# Define the registry path and key name
$registryPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"
$keyName = "MaxDevicePasswordFailedAttempts"

# Get the current value of the MaxDevicePasswordFailedAttempts registry key
$currentValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $keyName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Check if the registry key exists and its value is within the recommended range
if ($null -eq $currentValue) {
    Write-Host "The registry key does not exist. Manual configuration needed."
    Write-Host "Please configure 'Interactive logon: Machine account lockout threshold' via Group Policy."
    # Exit the script with code 1 to indicate audit failure
    exit 1
} elseif ($currentValue.$keyName -eq 0 -or $currentValue.$keyName -gt 10) {
    Write-Host "Non-compliant: The lockout threshold is set to $($currentValue.$keyName)."
    Write-Host "Please ensure it is set to 10 or fewer invalid logon attempts, but not 0."
    # Exit the script with code 1 to indicate audit failure
    exit 1
} else {
    Write-Host "Compliant: The lockout threshold is correctly set to $($currentValue.$keyName)."
    # Exit the script with code 0 to indicate audit success
    exit 0
}
# ```

# In this script:
# - We query the registry to check the value of `MaxDevicePasswordFailedAttempts`.
# - We ensure it exists and falls within the recommended range (1 to 10 inclusive).
# - Appropriate messages are displayed based on the current configuration, and the script exits with status code `0` for compliance and `1` for non-compliance.
