# Execute the function to perform the audit
Test-TokenObjectUserRight
# ```
# 
# Note:
# - This script assumes the registry key `CreateTokenPrivilege` is usually empty or not defined when the setting "No One" is correctly applied. 
# - The script checks the relevant setup in the system and advises users to manually verify and configure the settings if they do not meet compliance.
# - Exit codes are used to indicate pass (0) or fail (1) status of the audit.
