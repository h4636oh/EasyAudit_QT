# PowerShell 7 script to audit the setting for minimizing simultaneous connections
# Requirement: Ensure 'Minimize the number of simultaneous connections to the Internet or a Windows Domain' is set to 'Enabled: 3 = Prevent Wi-Fi when on Ethernet'

# Define the registry path and the expected value
$registryPath = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WcmSvc\GroupPolicy'
$registryValueName = 'fMinimizeConnections'
$expectedValue = 3

# Check if the registry path exists
if (-not (Test-Path -Path $registryPath)) {
    Write-Host "Registry path does not exist. Manual verification needed."
    exit 1
}

# Retrieve the current registry value
$currentValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $registryValueName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object -ExpandProperty $registryValueName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Compare the current value with the expected value
if ($null -eq $currentValue) {
    Write-Host "Registry value does not exist. Please verify the setting manually."
    exit 1
} elseif ($currentValue -eq $expectedValue) {
    Write-Host "Audit Passed: The setting is configured as expected."
    exit 0
} else {
    Write-Host "Audit Failed: Expected value is $expectedValue but found $currentValue. Please correct the setting."
    exit 1
}
# ```
# 
# This script checks the registry location specified in the audit instructions to verify that the correct policy setting is applied. If the registry path does not exist or if the registry value is not set to the expected value of 3, it prompts the user to manually verify or correct the configuration, and exits with an appropriate code depending on the audit result.
