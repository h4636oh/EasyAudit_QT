# This script audits whether the 'Adjust memory quotas for a process' policy is set to the recommended accounts: 'Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE'. It uses `secedit` to export the local security policy and compares the configuration against the expected values. It will output an audit result and exit with code 0 for success or 1 for an error or failure.
