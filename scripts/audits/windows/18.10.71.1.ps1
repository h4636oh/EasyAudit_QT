# This script:
# - Defines the registry path and value associated with the Widgets feature.
# - Checks whether the registry path exists.
# - Reads the current value of the `AllowNewsAndInterests` registry entry.
# - Compares it with the expected value (0) to determine if Widgets are disabled.
# - Exits with an appropriate code based on the audit result, using `exit 0` for a pass and `exit 1` for a fail.
