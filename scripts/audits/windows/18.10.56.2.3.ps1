# PowerShell 7 script to audit the Group Policy setting for 'Do not allow passwords to be saved'
# This script checks if the Remote Desktop Connection Client setting is 'Enabled' by verifying the registry key

# Define the registry path and value
$regPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services"
$regName = "DisablePasswordSaving"

# Function to check the registry key value
function Test-RemoteDesktopPasswordSavingPolicy {
    try {
        # Attempt to read the registry value
        $regValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name $regName -ErrorAction Stop

        # Check if the value is set to 1 (policy is enabled)
        if ($regValue.$regName -eq 1) {
            Write-Output "Audit Passed: 'Do not allow passwords to be saved' is set to 'Enabled'."
            exit 0
        } else {
            Write-Output "Audit Failed: 'Do not allow passwords to be saved' is NOT set to 'Enabled'."
            exit 1
        }
    } catch {
        # Handle the case where the registry path or key does not exist
        Write-Output "Audit Failed: Registry path or key does not exist. 'Do not allow passwords to be saved' is NOT configured."
        exit 1
    }
}

# Run the test function
Test-RemoteDesktopPasswordSavingPolicy

# If manual verification is required
Write-Output "If necessary, manually verify the Group Policy at the following path:"
Write-Output "Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Remote Desktop Services\\Remote Desktop Connection Client\\Do not allow passwords to be saved"

# This script checks if the policy 'Do not allow passwords to be saved' is enabled by verifying the corresponding registry value at `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services:DisablePasswordSaving`. If the registry value is set to `1`, the policy is enabled. The script exits with `0` for a pass and `1` for a fail, and it prompts the user to manually verify the group policy if needed.
