# PowerShell 7 Script to Audit 'Infrared monitor service (irmon)' Status

# This script audits the status of the 'Infrared monitor service (irmon)' to ensure compliance with security policies.
# It checks if the 'Start' registry key value is set to 4 (Disabled), or if the key does not exist, indicating that the service is not installed.

# Define the registry path and key
$registryPath = "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\irmon"
$registryKey = "Start"

# Try to retrieve the registry key value
try {
    $regValue = Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path $registryPath -Name $registryKey -ErrorAction Stop
} catch {
    # If the registry key does not exist, assume the service is not installed
    Write-Output "Audit Passed: The 'Infrared monitor service (irmon)' is not installed."
    exit 0
}

# Check if the service is disabled
if ($regValue -eq 4) {
    Write-Output "Audit Passed: The 'Infrared monitor service (irmon)' is disabled."
    exit 0
} else {
    Write-Output "Audit Failed: The 'Infrared monitor service (irmon)' is not set to 'Disabled'."
    Write-Output "Please set 'Infrared monitor service (irmon)' to 'Disabled' or uninstall it via Group Policy."
    exit 1
}
# ```
