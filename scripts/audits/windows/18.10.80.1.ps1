# 
### Explanation:
# - **Registry Path & Key**: The script defines the registry path and key to check the audit.
# - **Expected Value**: The setting should have a `REG_DWORD` value of 0, indicating the "Disabled" state.
# - **Functionality**: The script uses a function `Test-RegistrySetting` to try accessing the key and compare its value with the expected result.
# - **Error Handling**: It manages the scenario where the registry key is not found, suggesting manual application of the Group Policy template.
# - **Exit Codes**: The script exits with code `0` on success and `1` on failure, as required.
