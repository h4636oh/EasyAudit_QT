# This script verifies the policy setting for Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) to ensure that interactive communication with the support provider is disabled (a REG_DWORD value of 0). If the registry setting is configured as expected, the script exits with a status code of 0, indicating the audit passed. Otherwise, it exits with a status code of 1, indicating the audit failed.
