# PowerShell 7 script to audit the setting for prohibiting installation and configuration of Network Bridge on DNS domain networks.
# This script checks the registry key value to verify the policy setting.

# Define registry path and value name
$regPath = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Network\Connections'
$valueName = 'NC_AllowNetBridge_NLA'

# Attempt to get the registry value
try {
    $regValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name $valueName -ErrorAction Stop
} catch {
    Write-Host "Audit failed: Unable to retrieve the registry value. Please ensure the registry path and value exist."
    Exit 1
}

# Check if the registry value is set to the recommended state
if ($regValue.$valueName -eq 0) {
    Write-Host "Audit passed: The network bridge configuration is set correctly."
    Exit 0
} else {
    Write-Host "Audit failed: The network bridge configuration is not set correctly."
    Write-Host "Please navigate to 'Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Network\\Network Connections' and ensure 'Prohibit installation and configuration of Network Bridge on your DNS domain network' is set to 'Enabled'."

# This script checks the specified registry setting to determine if it has been configured correctly per the audit requirement. If the registry value is configured as recommended (a DWORD value of 0), the script will confirm the audit is passed. If the value is incorrect or the registry key does not exist, it will prompt the user to manually check the policy configuration. The script exits 0 for success and 1 for failure as specified.
