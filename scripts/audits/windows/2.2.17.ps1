### Comments
# - The script checks whether the "Deny log on as a batch job" policy includes the 'Guests' account.
# - It utilizes the `Get-CimInstance` cmdlet to examine user accounts and their membership.
# - The script investigates the registry for the current policy settings under "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon".
# - If 'Guests' is not included, it outputs a message informing the user and requires a manual update.
# - The script uses an exit code of 0 for success and 1 for failure as per the requirements.
