# This script audits the Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service to ensure it is either disabled or not installed, as per the audit requirements. It checks for the existence of the registry key and its value. If the key does not exist or the value is correctly set, it exits with 0, indicating a pass. If the value is not set correctly, it prompts the user to verify the configuration manually and exits with 1.
