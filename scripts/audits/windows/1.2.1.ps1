# PowerShell 7 script to audit the "Account lockout duration" policy setting

# Description: This script checks if the "Account lockout duration" is set to 15 or more minutes.
# Recommended state: 15 or more minutes.

# Function to get the "Account lockout duration" setting
function Get-AccountLockoutDuration {
    try {
        # Retrieve the Account lockout duration from the Default Domain Policy GPO
        $ldapPath = "LDAP://RootDSE"
        $rootDSE = [ADSI]$ldapPath
        $defaultNamingContext = $rootDSE.defaultNamingContext
        $domainPolicyPath = "LDAP://CN=Domain-Default-Policy,CN=Policies,CN=System,$defaultNamingContext"

        $domainPolicy = [ADSI]$domainPolicyPath
        $lockoutDuration = $domainPolicy.Properties["lockoutDuration"].Value

        # Convert the lockout duration from 100-nanosecond intervals to minutes
        $lockoutMinutes = -($lockoutDuration / (60 * 10000000))
    }
    catch {
        Write-Host "Error retrieving the Account lockout duration setting." -ForegroundColor Red
        exit 1
    }

    return $lockoutMinutes
}

# Main script logic
function Main {
    $lockoutDuration = Get-AccountLockoutDuration

    if ($lockoutDuration -ge 15) {
        Write-Host "Audit Passed: Account lockout duration is set to $lockoutDuration minutes, which meets the recommended setting." -ForegroundColor Green
        exit 0
    }
    else {
        Write-Host "Audit Failed: Account lockout duration is set to $lockoutDuration minutes." -ForegroundColor Red
        Write-Host "Please ensure the Account lockout duration is set to 15 or more minutes in the Default Domain Policy GPO." -ForegroundColor Yellow
        exit 1
    }
}

# Run the script
Main
# ```
# 
### Assumptions:
# - The script assumes access to the `Domain-Default-Policy` in the Active Directory environment to verify the policy.
# - LDAP paths and access to Active Directory are necessary for script execution.
# - The script's logic is based on checking the "lockoutDuration" property, which is typically used in Windows environments to represent the account lockout duration.
