# This PowerShell script audits the 'Audit Credential Validation' setting.
# The script checks if the setting is configured to 'Success and Failure' for auditing.
# It uses the 'auditpol' command to retrieve the current setting.

    $auditOutput = & auditpol /get /subcategory:"Credential Validation"

    # Check if the output contains both 'Success' and 'Failure'
    if ($auditOutput -match 'Success' -and $auditOutput -match 'Failure') {
        return $true
    } else {
        return $false
    }
}

# Assess the audit setting and determine the appropriate exit code
if (Test-CredentialValidationAudit) {
    Write-Host "Audit Credential Validation is set to 'Success and Failure'."
    exit 0
} else {
    Write-Host "Audit Credential Validation is NOT set to 'Success and Failure'. Please configure it manually."

# Prompt for manual check in case of audit failure
Read-Host -Prompt "Ensure the setting 'Audit Credential Validation' is manually configured to 'Success and Failure' through Group Policy or equivalent method"
