# PowerShell 7 script to audit the registry setting for the Internet Connection Wizard policy

# Define the registry path and value name
$regPath = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Internet Connection'
$regKey = 'Wizard'
$regValueName = 'ExitOnMSICW'

# Define the expected value for the registry setting
$expectedValue = 1

# Try to get the registry value
try {
    # Check if the registry key exists
    if (Test-Path "$regPath\$regKey") {
        # Get the current registry value
        $currentValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path "$regPath\$regKey" -Name $regValueName -ErrorAction Stop

        # Compare the current value with the expected value
        if ($currentValue.$regValueName -eq $expectedValue) {
            Write-Host "Audit Passed: The registry value '$regValueName' is set to the expected state ($expectedValue)."
            exit 0
        }
        else {
            Write-Host "Audit Failed: The registry value '$regValueName' is not set to the expected state ($expectedValue)."
            Write-Host "Please navigate to the Group Policy settings and ensure it is set to Enabled."
            exit 1
        }
    }
    else {
        Write-Host "Audit Failed: The registry key '$regPath\$regKey' does not exist."
        Write-Host "Please navigate to the Group Policy settings and ensure it is configured correctly."

# The script checks the registry setting related to the Internet Connection Wizard. It verifies that the specified value is set correctly and exits with code 0 if the setting matches the expected state or code 1 if it doesn't. The script also provides guidance for manual audit steps if the setting is not configured as expected.
