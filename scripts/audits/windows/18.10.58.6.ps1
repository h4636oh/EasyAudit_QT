# PowerShell 7 Script to Audit 'Allow search and Cortana to use location' Setting

# Define the registry path and expected value

            exit 1
        }
    } catch {
        Write-Host "Audit Failed: Unable to read the registry path or value. Please check manually."
        Write-Host "Navigate to Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Search and ensure 'Allow search and Cortana to use location' is set to Disabled."

# Execute the audit check
Check-SearchAndCortanaLocationSetting

# This script audits the registry setting at `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Search`, ensuring that `AllowSearchToUseLocation` is set to `0` (Disabled) as recommended for enterprise environments. If successful, it exits with status 0, otherwise, it provides a manual intervention prompt and exits with status 1. The script adheres to PowerShell 7 syntax and best practices.
