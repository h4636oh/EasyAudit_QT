# PowerShell 7 Script to Audit 'Load and unload device drivers' Policy Setting
<#
    This script audits whether the 'Load and unload device drivers' policy setting
    is correctly set to 'Administrators'. This is required for maintaining proper 
    security controls in a corporate or enterprise environment.
    
    According to the input, the policy should be set to 'Administrators' only.
    If it's not set correctly, the script will exit with code 1 (audit failure).
    Otherwise, it will exit with code 0 (audit success).
