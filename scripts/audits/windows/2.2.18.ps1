# Note:
# - This script assumes the availability of a `Get-LocalPolSecuritySetting` cmdlet, which would need to be available or replaced with the correct method for accessing local security policies specific to your environment.
# - The script only audits the setting as per the requirement and does not make any changes.
# - The script outputs instructions if manual intervention is required to rectify an audit failure.
