# This script audits whether the Group Policy setting 'Prevent non-admin users from installing packaged Windows apps' is enabled.
# Requirement is to audit the registry setting backed by the policy described in:
# HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Appx:BlockNonAdminUserInstall

# Define the registry path and value name
$registryPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Appx"
$valueName = "BlockNonAdminUserInstall"

try {
    # Check if the registry key exists
    $regKey = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -ErrorAction Stop

    # Verify if the value is set to 1
    if ($regKey.$valueName -eq 1) {
        Write-Host "Audit passed: 'Prevent non-admin users from installing packaged Windows apps' is set to 'Enabled'."
        exit 0
    } else {
        Write-Host "Audit failed: 'Prevent non-admin users from installing packaged Windows apps' is NOT set to 'Enabled'."
        exit 1
    }
} catch {
    # If there's an error accessing the registry path, assume it's not set correctly
    Write-Host "Audit failed: Unable to access the registry path or the setting is not configured."
    Write-Host "Please navigate to Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> App Package Deployment"
    Write-Host "And ensure 'Prevent non-admin users from installing packaged Windows apps' is set to 'Enabled'."
    exit 1
}
# ```
# 
# **Explanation**:
# - The script checks for the existence and value of a specific registry key (`BlockNonAdminUserInstall`) in `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Appx`.
# - The required audit condition is for the registry value to be set to `1`.
# - If the condition is met, it indicates the policy is enabled and outputs a success message with an exit code `0`.
# - If the condition is not met, it outputs a failure message and exits with code `1`.
# - The script handles errors such as inaccessible registry paths, prompting the user to manually check the policy settings in Group Policy.
