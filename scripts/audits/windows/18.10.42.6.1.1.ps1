# This script checks the Windows registry to determine if the Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules are enabled on a Windows machine, as recommended. If it is unable to read the registry or the value isn't set to 1, it prompts the user to verify and configure ASR rules manually using the Group Policy path provided in the requirements.
