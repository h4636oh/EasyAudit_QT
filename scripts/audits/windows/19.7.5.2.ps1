# This script checks the registry setting for each user under `HKEY_USERS` to verify if the policy 'Notify antivirus programs when opening attachments' is set to 'Enabled'. It assumes a `REG_DWORD` value of `3` indicates the 'Enabled' state. If any discrepancies are found, it prompts the user to verify the setting manually through the Group Policy editor and exits with a status code of `1` to indicate audit failure. The script exits with a `0` if the audit passes for all users.
