# This script checks whether the registry setting for limiting access to only the private store within the Microsoft Store is configured correctly. If the registry value `RequirePrivateStoreOnly` is set to `1`, the script reports that the audit has passed. If the value is not set correctly or the registry key does not exist, the script prompts the user to configure the Group Policy manually, and reports that the audit has failed.
