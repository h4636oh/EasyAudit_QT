# PowerShell 7 Script for auditing the Windows Firewall public profile logging path

# Define the expected log file path
$expectedLogFilePath = "$($env:SystemRoot)\System32\logfiles\firewall\publicfw.log"

# Define the registry path to the setting
$registryPath = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PublicProfile\Logging'
$registryValueName = 'LogFilePath'

# Try to read the current log file path from the registry
try {
    $currentLogFilePath = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $registryValueName -ErrorAction Stop | Select-Object -ExpandProperty $registryValueName
} catch {
    Write-Host "Audit Failed: Unable to retrieve registry value. Ensure the policy has been applied." -ForegroundColor Red
    exit 1
}

# Compare the current log file path with the expected path
if ($currentLogFilePath -eq $expectedLogFilePath) {
    Write-Host "Audit Passed: The Windows Firewall public profile log file path is configured correctly." -ForegroundColor Green
    exit 0
} else {
    Write-Host "Audit Failed: The Windows Firewall public profile log file path is not configured correctly. Current path: $currentLogFilePath" -ForegroundColor Red
    Write-Host "Please manually configure the setting to: $expectedLogFilePath" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    exit 1
}

### Commentary:
# - The script checks the Windows Firewall public profile logging path in the registry against the expected value.
# - If the path matches, the script exits with a code `0` indicating the audit passed.
# - If the path does not match or cannot be retrieved, the script prompts the user to manually set the path and exits with a code `1`.
