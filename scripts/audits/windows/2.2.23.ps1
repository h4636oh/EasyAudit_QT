# Note: This script uses the `Get-SeSecurityPolicy` cmdlet from the Security cmdlets available in PowerShell to retrieve the policy settings. If this cmdlet is unavailable by default in PowerShell 7, you may need to execute this script in Windows PowerShell, which provides the necessary access to security policies. Always execute scripts with proper privileges.
