### Notes:
# - This script audits the user rights assignment for changing the time zone to ensure it matches the expected users: 'Administrators', 'LOCAL SERVICE', 'Users'.
# - The function `Get-LocalGroupPolicy` is a placeholder, as PowerShell doesn't have a direct built-in cmdlet for this purpose. In practice, a method or tool that can fetch local group policy settings should replace it.
# - The script checks if the current configuration matches exactly the expected configuration, potentially requiring modification if integrated with suitable PowerShell modules or custom scripts/tools.
# - If the audit detects any discrepancies, it outputs a failure message and exits with status `1`. If the audit passes, it outputs a success message and exits with status `0`.
