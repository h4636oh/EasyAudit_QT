# This PowerShell script audits the LDAP client signing configuration by checking the `LDAPClientIntegrity` registry value. If it's set to 1 (which corresponds to "Negotiate signing" or higher), the audit passes. Otherwise, the script warns the user to manually set it and indicates failure by returning an exit code of 1.
