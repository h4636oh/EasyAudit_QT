# Title: 2.3.7.1 (L1) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Do not require CTRL+ALT+DEL' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)
# Description: This script audits the policy setting to ensure that 'Interactive logon: Do not require CTRL+ALT+DEL' is set to 'Disabled'.
# Profile Applicability: Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)
# Script Version: 1.0
# Audit Requirement: Check registry value to ensure security policy is correctly configured.

# Define the registry path and value name
$registryPath = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System'
$valueName = 'DisableCAD'

# Attempt to read the registry value
try {
    $regValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $valueName -ErrorAction Stop
    if ($regValue.$valueName -eq 0) {
        Write-Output "Audit Passed: 'Interactive logon: Do not require CTRL+ALT+DEL' is set to 'Disabled'."
        exit 0
    } else {
        Write-Output "Audit Failed: 'Interactive logon: Do not require CTRL+ALT+DEL' is NOT set to 'Disabled'."
        exit 1
    }
} catch {
    Write-Warning "Audit Failed: Unable to read the registry key. Please check if the path is correct and accessible."
    exit 1
}

# Note:
# - The audit checks if the value is set to 0, meaning CTRL+ALT+DEL is required.
# - The script does not make any changes to the registry, ensuring it's audit-only.
