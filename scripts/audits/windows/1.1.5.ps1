### Explanation

# - This script audits the setting 'Password must meet complexity requirements'.
# - It checks the registry entry typically associated with this policy in a local security context.
# - If the value is set to 1, it indicates the policy is enabled, and the script exits with code 0, indicating success.
# - If not, it prints a message instructing the user to manually enable the setting and exits with code 1, indicating the audit failed.
# - Note that the path used (`HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System`) should be adapted according to correct context or environment, as this typically applies in domain-level context via group policy and might not reflect directly in registry for default domain policies.
