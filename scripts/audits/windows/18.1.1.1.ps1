# PowerShell 7 Script to Audit Lock Screen Camera Setting

# Define the registry path and key
$registryPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Personalization"
$registryKey = "NoLockScreenCamera"

        $currentValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $registryKey -ErrorAction Stop | Select-Object -ExpandProperty $registryKey

        # Check if the current value matches the expected value
        if ($currentValue -eq $expectedValue) {
            Write-Host "Audit Passed: The lock screen camera setting is configured correctly."
            exit 0
        } else {
            Write-Host "Audit Failed: The lock screen camera setting does not match the expected value."
            Write-Host "Please manually set 'Prevent enabling lock screen camera' to 'Enabled' in Group Policy."
            exit 1
        }
    } else {
        Write-Host "Audit Failed: The registry path for lock screen camera setting is not found."
        Write-Host "Please manually set 'Prevent enabling lock screen camera' to 'Enabled' in Group Policy."
        exit 1

} catch {
    Write-Host "Error: Unable to query the registry. $_"
    exit 1

# This script checks the registry setting for preventing the enabling of the lock screen camera. If the setting matches the expected value (1), it reports success. If it doesn't, or if there's an error accessing the registry, it asks the user to manually check or set the policy in Group Policy.
