# This script checks the Windows registry to ensure the specific policy setting is set to 'Enabled' by checking if the `PreventDeviceMetadataFromNetwork` value is set to `1`. If not found or set incorrectly, it advises the user on manual remediation steps through Group Policy Editor and exits with a failure code.
