# Title: 5.34 (L2) Ensure 'Windows Event Collector (Wecsvc)' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)
# Profile Applicability: Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

# Description:
# This service manages persistent subscriptions to events from remote sources that support WS-Management protocol.
# The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

# Rationale:
# In a high security environment, remote connections to secure workstations should be minimized, and management functions should be done locally.

# Impact:
# If this service is stopped or disabled, event subscriptions cannot be created and forwarded events cannot be accepted.

# Audit:
# This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a REG_DWORD value of 4.
# HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Wecsvc:Start

# Default Value:
# Manual

# Audit Script: Check if the 'Windows Event Collector (Wecsvc)' is set to 'Disabled'
try {
    $registryPath = "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Wecsvc"
    $registryValueName = "Start"

    # Retrieve the current value of the Start registry
    $registryValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -ErrorAction Stop |
                     Select-Object -ExpandProperty $registryValueName

    if ($registryValue -eq 4) {
        Write-Host "Audit Passed: 'Windows Event Collector (Wecsvc)' is set to 'Disabled'."
        exit 0
    } else {
        Write-Host "Audit Failed: 'Windows Event Collector (Wecsvc)' is not set to 'Disabled'. Please verify settings manually."
        exit 1
    }
} catch {
    Write-Host "Error accessing the registry path or value. Please ensure you have the appropriate permissions."
    exit 1
}
# ```
# 
# This script performs an audit by checking the registry value that determines whether the 'Windows Event Collector' service is set to 'Disabled'. If the value matches the expected disabled state (4), it confirms the audit is passed, otherwise, it prompts the user to verify the settings manually, and exits with appropriate status codes as requested.
