# This script audits whether the policy 'Allow access to BitLocker-protected fixed data drives from earlier versions of Windows' is set to 'Disabled' as expected. The script checks the specified registry location and verifies if the value is empty or not set, indicating the policy is disabled. If the policy is not compliant, it exits with status code 1, and if it passes, it exits with status code 0.
