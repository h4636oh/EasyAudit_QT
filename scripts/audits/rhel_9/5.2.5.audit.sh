# Audit Script to Ensure Re-authentication for Privilege Escalation
# This script checks if re-authentication for privilege escalation is configured properly.
# It searches /etc/sudoers and /etc/sudoers.d/* files for any occurrence of '!authenticate'.

# Grep command to find occurrences of !authenticate in sudoers files
unauth_entries=$(grep -r "^[^#].*\!authenticate" /etc/sudoers*)

# Check if there are any lines found with !authenticate
if [[ -n "$unauth_entries" ]]; then
    echo "AUDIT FAILURE: Found lines with '!authenticate' in sudoers files:"
    echo "$unauth_entries"
    echo "Please manually remove '!authenticate' tags in the listed files using visudo."
    exit 1
else
    echo "AUDIT SUCCESS: No '!authenticate' tags found in sudoers files. Re-authentication for privilege escalation is properly configured."
    exit 0
fi
```

This script searches for the presence of `!authenticate` entries in the `/etc/sudoers` and `/etc/sudoers.d/*` files which indicates privilege escalation without re-authentication, thus auditing the proper configuration of privilege escalation settings. If found, it alerts the user and provides guidance to correct it manually. If no such entries are found, it confirms the audit passes successfully.
