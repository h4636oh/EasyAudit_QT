This script verifies if `ForwardToSyslog` is set to `no` in the configuration for journald logging. If `rsyslog` is active, it assumes that `journald` is not the current method being used, and thus, it bypasses the audit check. If `journald` is used, it checks the setting and provides relevant messages according to the audit result.
