# Main execution
check_weak_macs

### Script Explanation:
# - **Purpose**: The script is designed to audit SSHD's MAC configuration for the presence of any weak MAC algorithms, using a predefined list of weak MACs.
# - **Check Function**: The `check_weak_macs` function runs the `sshd -T` command to print the SSH daemon's effective configuration and `grep` is used with a regex to search for any usage of known weak MAC algorithms.
# - **Exit Codes**: 
#   - Exits with status `1` if weak MACs are found, indicating an audit failure.
#   - Exits with status `0` if no weak MACs are found, indicating an audit success.
# - **Manual Step Prompt**: Provides a message for the user to manually review a CVE and check the systemâ€™s patch status as part of the audit procedure.
