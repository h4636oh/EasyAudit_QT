# Explanation
- The script checks for the installed version of PAM using `rpm -q pam`.
- If PAM is not installed, it reports and exits with status `1`.
- If PAM is installed, it checks if the version is `1.5.1-19` or greater.
- If the version requirement is met, it exits with status `0`.
- If the version is not sufficient, it advises the user to manually update PAM and exits with status `1`.
