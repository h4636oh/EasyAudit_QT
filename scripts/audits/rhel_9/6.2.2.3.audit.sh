# Assumptions:
# - This script checks for the presence of rsyslog to determine if journald is in use, as the audit is only applicable if journald is used.
# - If Compress=yes is found, the audit is considered passed; otherwise, it fails.
# - The script adheres to best practices by including error checking mechanisms (e.g., checking if rsyslog is active) and exits appropriately based on the results of the audit command.
