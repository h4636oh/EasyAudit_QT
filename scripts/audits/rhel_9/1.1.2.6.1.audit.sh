### Explanation:
# - **findmnt:** This command is used to check the current mount status of filesystems. The `-k` option lists entries from `/etc/fstab`, `/etc/mtab`, and the kernel, while `-n` suppresses the column headers in the output.
# - **Output Check:** The script checks if the output of `findmnt` contains information that matches `/var/log`. If found, it assumes that `/var/log` is a separate partition, otherwise, not.
# - **Exit Status:** The script exits with status `0` if `/var/log` is mounted, otherwise, it prompts the user to manually ensure a separate partition for `/var/log` and exits with status `1`.
# - **Comments:** Inline comments explain the purpose of sections and commands for clarity.

# Please adjust the condition in the script depending on the specific output format of `findmnt` on different systems, as the filesystem type and options could vary.
