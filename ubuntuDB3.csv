Internal Only - General  1.1.2 Configure Filesystem Partitions  
Directories that are used for system -wide functions can be further protected by placing 
them on separate partitions. This provides protection for resource exhaustion and 
enables the use of mounting options that are applicable to the directory's intended us e. 
Users' data can be stored on separate partitions and have stricter mount options. A user 
partition is a filesystem that has been established for use by the users and does not 
contain software for system operations.  
The recommendations in this section are easier to perform during initial system 
installation. If the system is already installed, it is recommended that a full backup be 
performed before repartitioning the system.  
Note:  
-IF- you are repartitioning a system that has already been installed (This may require 
the system to be in single -user mode):  
• Mount the new partition to a temporary mountpoint e.g. mount /dev/sda2 /mnt   
• Copy data from the original partition to the new partition. e.g. cp -a /var/tmp/* 
/mnt  
• Verify that all data is present on the new partition. e.g. ls -la /mnt   
• Unmount the new partition. e.g. umount /mnt   
• Remove the data from the original directory that was in the old partition. e.g. rm -
Rf /var/tmp/*  Otherwise it will still consume space in the old partition that will be 
masked when the new filesystem is mounted.  
• Mount the new partition to the desired mountpoint. e.g. mount /dev/sda2 
/var/tmp   
• Update /etc/fstab  with the new mountpoint. e.g. /dev/sda2 /var/tmp xfs

1.1.2.1.1 Ensure /tmp is a separate partition (Automated),"•  Level 1 - Server  
•  Level 1 - Workstation","The /tmp directory is a world -writable directory used for temporary storage by all users 
and some applications.  
- IF - an entry for /tmp exists in /etc/fstab  it will take precedence over entries in 
systemd default unit file.  
Note:  In an environment where the main system is diskless and connected to iSCSI, 
entries in /etc/fstab  may not take precedence.  
/tmp can be configured to use tmpfs . 
tmpfs  puts everything into the kernel internal caches and grows and shrinks to 
accommodate the files it contains and is able to swap unneeded pages out to swap 
space. It has maximum size limits which can be adjusted on the fly via mount -o 
remount . 
Since tmpfs  lives completely in the page cache and on swap, all tmpfs  pages will be 
shown as ""Shmem"" in /proc/meminfo  and ""Shared"" in free. Notice that these counters 
also include shared memory. The most reliable way to get the count is using df and du. 
tmpfs  has three mount options for sizing:  
• size: The limit of allocated bytes for this tmpfs  instance. The default is half of 
your physical RAM without swap. If you oversize your tmpfs  instances the 
machine will deadlock since the OOM handler will not be able to free that 
memory.  
• nr_blocks : The same as size, but in blocks of PAGE_SIZE.  
• nr_inodes : The maximum number of inodes for this instance. The default is half 
of the number of your physical RAM pages, or (on a machine with highmem) the 
number of lowmem RAM pages, whichever is the lower.  
These parameters accept a suffix k, m or g and can be changed on remount. The size 
parameter also accepts a suffix % to limit this tmpfs  instance to that percentage of your 
physical RAM. The default, when neither size nor nr_blocks  is specified, is size=50% .  
Internal Only - General","Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options 
such as the noexec  option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install 
executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a 
system setuid  program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, 
the hard link would be broken, and the attacker would have his own copy of the 
program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could 
continue to exploit the known flaw.  
This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs  to /tmp, or creating a separate 
partition for /tmp. 
Impact:  
By design files saved to /tmp should have no expectation of surviving a reboot of the 
system. tmpfs  is ram based and all files stored to tmpfs  will be lost when the system is 
rebooted.  
If files need to be persistent through a reboot, they should be saved to /var/tmp  not 
/tmp. 
Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world -writable, there is a risk of resource 
exhaustion if it is not bound to tmpfs  or a separate partition.  
Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under 
it, but in a configuration where /tmp is not a separate file system it will essentially have 
the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single / partition. On 
the other hand, a RAM -based /tmp (as with tmpfs ) will almost certainly be much 
smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. 
Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for /tmp from a separate volume or 
disk. One of the downsides of a disk -based dedicated partition is that it will be slower 
than tmpfs  which is RAM -based.

Patch management procedures may vary widely between enterprises. Large enterprises 
may choose to install a local updates server that can be used in place of their 
distributions servers, whereas a single deployment of a system may prefer to get 
updates dire ctly. Updates can be performed automatically or manually, depending on 
the site's policy for patch management. Organizations may prefer to test patches 
against their environment on a non -production system before rolling out to production.  
Outdated software is vulnerable to cyber criminals and hackers. Software updates help 
reduce the risk to your organization. The release of software update notes often reveals  
the patched exploitable entry points to the public. Public knowledge of these exploits 
can make  your organization more vulnerable to malicious actors attempting to gain 
entry to your system's data.  
Software updates often offer new and improved features and speed enhancements.  
For the purpose of this benchmark, the requirement is to ensure that a patch 
management process is defined and maintained, the specifics of which are left to the

• upgrade - is used to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed 
on the system from the sources enumerated in /etc/apt/sources.list. Packages 
currently installed with new versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under 
no circumsta nces are currently installed packages removed, or packages not 
already installed retrieved and installed. New versions of currently installed 
packages that cannot be upgraded without changing the install status of another 
package will be left at their curr ent version. An update must be performed first so 
that apt knows that new versions of packages are available.  
• dist-upgrade - in addition to performing the function of upgrade, also intelligently 
handles changing dependencies with new versions of packages; apt has a 
""smart"" conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most 
important packages at th e expense of less important ones if necessary. So, dist -
upgrade command may remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file 
contains a list of locations from which to retrieve desired package files. See also

Description:  
GNOME Desktop Manager can lock down specific settings by using the lockdown mode 
in dconf to prevent users from changing specific settings.  
To lock down a dconf key or subpath, create a locks subdirectory in the keyfile directory. 
The files inside this directory contain a list of keys or subpaths to lock. Just as with the 
keyfiles, you may add any number of files to this directory.  
Rationale:

notify rpcbind  when they start, registering the ports they are listening on and the RPC 
program numbers they expect to serve. The client system then contacts rpcbind  on the 
server with a particular RPC program number. The rpcbind.service  redirects the client 
to the proper port number so it can communicate with the requested service.  
Portmapper is an RPC service, which always listens on tcp and udp 111, and is used to 
map other RPC services (such as nfs, nlockmgr, quotad, mountd, etc.) to their 
corresponding port number on the server. When a remote host makes an RPC call to 
that server , it first consults with portmap to determine where the RPC server is listening.","A small request (~82 bytes via UDP) sent to the Portmapper generates a large 
response (7x to 28x amplification), which makes it a suitable tool for DDoS attacks. If

Description:  
Mail Transfer Agents (MTA), such as sendmail and Postfix, are used to listen for 
incoming mail and transfer the messages to the appropriate user or mail server. If the 
system is not intended to be a mail server, it is recommended that the MTA be 
configured  to only process local mail.  
Rationale:  
The software for all Mail Transfer Agents is complex and most have a long history of 
security issues. While it is important to ensure that the system can process local mail 
messages, it is not necessary to have the MTA's daemon listening on a port unless t he 
server is intended to be a mail server that receives and processes mail from other 
systems.

Internal Only - General  2.3.2 Configure systemd -timesyncd  
systemd-timesyncd  is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system 
clock across the network. It implements an SNTP client. In contrast to NTP 
implementations such as chrony or the NTP reference server this only implements a 
client side, and does not bother with  the full NTP complexity, focusing only on querying 
time from one remote server and synchronizing the local clock to it. The daemon runs 
with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with networkd to only operate when 
network connectivit y is available. The daemon saves the current clock to disk every time 
a new NTP sync has been acquired, and uses this to possibly correct the system clock 
early at bootup, in order to accommodate for systems that lack an RTC such as the 
Raspberry Pi and em bedded devices, and make sure that time monotonically 
progresses on these systems, even if it is not always correct. To make use of this 
daemon a new system user and group ""systemd -timesync"" needs to be created on 
installation of systemd.  
The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is only needed 
when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults. Initially, the main configuration file 
in /etc/systemd/ contains commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide  to the 
administrator. Local overrides can be created by editing this file or by creating drop -ins, 
as described below. Using drop -ins for local configuration is recommended over 
modifications to the main configuration file.  
In addition to the ""main"" configuration file, drop -in configuration snippets are read from 
/usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/ , /usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/ , and 
/etc/systemd/*.conf.d/ . Those drop -ins have higher precedence and override the 
main configuration file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration subdirectories are sorted by 
their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories they 
reside. When multip le files specify the same option, for options which accept just a 
single valu e, the entry in the file sorted last takes precedence, and for options which 
accept a list of values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.  
When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install drop -ins under 
/usr/. Files in /etc/ are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to 
override the configuration files installed by vendor packages. Drop -ins have to be used 
to override package drop -ins, since the main configuration file has lower precedence. It 
is recommended to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two -digit number 
and a dash, to simplify the ordering of the files.  
To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place 
a symlink to /dev/null in the configuration directory in /etc/, with the same filename as 
the vendor configuration file.",TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2.3.1.1,Ensure a single time synchronization daemon is in use,TRUE,93

Internal Only - General  4 Host Based Firewall  
A firewall is a set of rules. When a data packet moves into or out of a protected network 
space, its contents (in particular, information about its origin, target, and the protocol it 
plans to use) are tested against the firewall rules to see if it should be allowed through  
To provide a Host Based Firewall, the Linux kernel includes support for:  
• Netfilter - A set of hooks inside the Linux kernel that allows kernel modules to 
register callback functions with the network stack. A registered callback function 
is then called back for every packet that traverses the respective hook within the 
network s tack. Includes the ip_tables, ip6_tables, arp_tables, and ebtables kernel 
modules. These modules are some of the significant parts of the Netfilter hook 
system.  
• nftables - A subsystem of the Linux kernel providing filtering and classification of 
network packets/datagrams/frames. nftables is supposed to replace certain parts 
of Netfilter, while keeping and reusing most of it. nftables utilizes the building 
blocks o f the Netfilter infrastructure, such as the existing hooks into the 
networking stack, connection tracking system, userspace queueing component, 
and logging subsystem. Is available in Linux kernels 3.13 and newer . 
In order to configure firewall rules for Netfilter or nftables, a firewall utility needs to be 
installed. Guidance has been included for the following firewall utilities:  
• UncomplicatedFirewall (ufw) - Provides firewall features by acting as a front -end 
for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the iptables backend. ufw supports 
both IPv4 and IPv6 networks  
• nftables - Includes the nft utility for configuration of the nftables subsystem of the 
Linux kernel  
• iptables - Includes the iptables, ip6tables, arptables and ebtables utilities for 
configuration Netfilter and the ip_tables, ip6_tables, arp_tables, and ebtables 
kernel modules.  
Note:  
• Only one method should be used to configure a firewall on the system. Use of 
more than one method could produce unexpected results

Internal Only - General  4.2 Configure nftables  
If Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) or iptables are being used in your environment, 
please follow the guidance in their respective section and pass -over the guidance 
in this section.  
nftables is a subsystem of the Linux kernel providing filtering and classification of 
network packets/datagrams/frames and is the successor to iptables. The biggest 
change with the successor nftables is its simplicity. With iptables, we have to configure 
every single rule and use the syntax which can be compared with normal commands. 
With nftables, the simpler syntax, much like BPF (Berkely Packet Filter) means shorter 
lines and less repetition. Support for nftables should also be compiled into the kernel, 
together with the related nftables modules. Please ensure that your kernel supports 
nf_tables before choosing this option.  
Note:  
• This section broadly assumes starting with an empty nftables firewall ruleset 
(established by flushing the rules with nft flush ruleset).  
• Remediation steps included only affect the live system, you will also need to 
configure your default firewall configuration to apply on boot.  
• Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection will 
often result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good firewall 
configuration set to run on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a 
script that is  then run and tested before saving to boot.  
The following will implement the firewall rules of this section and open ICMP, IGMP, and 
port 22(ssh) from anywhere. Opening the ports for ICMP, IGMP, and port 22(ssh) needs 
to be updated in accordance with local site policy. Allow port 22(ssh) needs to be 
updated to only allow systems requiring ssh connectivity to connect, as per site 
policy .

Internal Only - General  5.1 Configure SSH Server  
Secure Shell (SSH) is a secure, encrypted replacement for common login services such 
as telnet , ftp, rlogin , rsh, and rcp. It is strongly recommended that sites abandon 
older clear -text login protocols and use SSH to prevent session hijacking and sniffing of 
sensitive data off the network.  
Note:  
• The recommendations in this section only apply if the SSH daemon is installed 
on the system, if remote access is not required the SSH daemon can be 
removed and this section skipped . 
• The openSSH daemon configuration directives, Include  and Match , may cause 
the audits in this section's recommendations to report incorrectly. It is 
recommended that these options only be used if they're needed and fully 
understood. If these options are configured in accordance with local site policy, 
they should be a ccounted for when following the recommendations in this 
section.  
• The default Include  location is the /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d  directory. This 
default has been accounted for in this section. If a file has an additional Include  
that isn't this default location, the files should be reviewed to verify that the 
recommended setting is not being over -ridden.  
• The audits of the running configuration in this section are run in the context of the 
root user, the local host name, and the local host's IP address. If a Match  block 
exists that matches one of these criteria, the output of the audit will be from the 
match block. The respective matched criteria should be replaced with a non -
matching substitution.  
• Include :  
o Include the specified configuration file(s).  
o Multiple pathnames may be specified and each pathname may contain 
glob(7) wildcards that will be expanded and processed in lexical order.  
o Files without absolute paths are assumed to be in /etc/ssh/ .

Rationale:  
Even though the .rhosts  files are ineffective if support is disabled in /etc/pam.conf , 
disabling the ability to use .rhosts  files in SSH provides an additional layer of 
protection.

" 5.1.7 Ensure sshd ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax 
are configured (Automated)","•  Level 1 - Server  
•  Level 1 - Workstation","Note:  To clarify, the two settings described below are only meant for idle connections 
from a protocol perspective and are not meant to check if the user is active or not. An 
idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not and never had, intentionally,  
the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before 8.2p1  there was a bug that 
caused these values to behave in such a manner that they were abused to disconnect 
idle users. This bug has been resolved in 8.2p1  and thus it can no longer be abuse d 
disconnect idle users.  
The two options ClientAliveInterval  and ClientAliveCountMax  control the timeout of 
SSH sessions. Taken directly from man 5 sshd_config : 
• ClientAliveInterval  Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data 
has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the 
encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, 
indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client.  
• ClientAliveCountMax  Sets the number of client alive messages which may be 
sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this 
threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will 
disconnect the client, terminating the session. It i s important to note that the use 
of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive 
messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be 
spoofable. The TCP keepalive option en ‐abled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. 
The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on 
knowing when a connection has become unresponsive. The default value is 3. If 
ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left a t the default, 
unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. 
Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination.  
   
Internal Only - General","In order to prevent resource exhaustion, appropriate values should be set for both 
ClientAliveInterval  and ClientAliveCountMax . Specifically, looking at the source 
code, ClientAliveCountMax  must be greater than zero in order to utilize the ability of 
SSH to drop idle connections. If connections are allowed to stay open indefinitely, this 
can potentially be used as a DDOS attack or simple resource exhaustion could occur 
over unreliable networ ks. 
The example set here is a 45 second timeout. Consult your site policy for network 
timeouts and apply as appropriate.","Run the following command and verify ClientAliveInterval  and ClientAliveCountMax  
are greater than zero:  
# sshd -T | grep -Pi -- '(clientaliveinterval|clientalivecountmax)'

Invalid arguments are ignored and do not otherwise affect the success or failure of the

module, the module must be written correctly to log the error to this file.

Internal Only - General  5.3.3.2 Configure pam_pwquality module  
The pam_pwquality.so  module checks the strength of passwords. It performs checks 
such as making sure a password is not a dictionary word, it is a certain length, contains 
a mix of characters (e.g. alphabet, numeric, other) and more.  
These checks are configurable by either:  
• use of the module arguments  
• modifying the /etc/security/pwquality.conf  configuration file  
• creating a .conf  file in the /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/  directory.  
Note:  The module arguments override the settings in the 
/etc/security/pwquality.conf  configuration file. Settings in the 
/etc/security/pwquality.conf  configuration file override settings in a .conf  file in the 
/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/  directory.  
The possible options in the file are:  
• difok  - Number of characters in the new password that must not be present in 
the old password. (default 1). The special value of 0 disables all checks of 
similarity of the new password with the old password except the new password 
being exactly the same as the old one.  
• minlen  - Minimum acceptable size for the new password (plus one if credits are 
not disabled which is the default). (See pam_pwquality(8).) Cannot be set to 
lower value than 6. (default 8)  
• dcredit  - The maximum credit for having digits in the new password. If less than 
0 it is the minimum number of digits in the new password. (default 0)  
• ucredit  - The maximum credit for having uppercase characters in the new 
password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of uppercase characters in the 
new password. (default 0)  
• lcredit  - The maximum credit for having lowercase characters in the new 
password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of lowercase characters in the 
new password. (default 0)  
• ocredit  - The maximum credit for having other characters in the new password. 
If less than 0 it is the minimum number of other characters in the new password. 
(default 0)  
• minclass  - The minimum number of required classes of characters for the new 
password (digits, uppercase, lowercase, others). (default 0)  
• maxrepeat  - The maximum number of allowed same consecutive characters in 
the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0)  
• maxsequence  - The maximum length of monotonic character sequences in the 
new password. Examples of such sequence are '12345' or 'fedcb'. Note that most 
such passwords will not pass the simplicity check unless the sequence is only a 
minor part of the password. The che ck is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0)#!/usr/bin/env bash",,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,5.3.3.1.3,Ensure password failed attempts lockout includes root account,TRUE,192

Impact:  
In general, it is true that longer passwords are better (harder to crack), but it is also true 
that forced password length requirements can cause user behavior that is predictable

password may cause them to choose repeating patterns like fourfourfourfour or 
passwordpassword that meet the requirement but aren’t hard to guess. Additionally, 
length requirements increase the chances that users will adopt other insecure practices, 
like writing them down, re -using them or storing them unencrypted in their documents.

s, @ for a, 1 for l, 0 for o.

Profile Applicability:  
•  Level 1 - Server  
•  Level 1 - Workstation  
Description:  
A cryptographic hash function converts an arbitrary -length input into a fixed length 
output. Password hashing performs a one -way transformation of a password, turning 
the password into another string, called the hashed password.  
The pam_unix  module can be configured to use one of the following hashing algorithms 
for user's passwords:  
• md5 - When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with the MD5 algorithm.  
• bigcrypt  - When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with the DEC C2  
algorithm.  
• sha256  - When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with the SHA256  
algorithm. The SHA256  algorithm must be supported by the crypt(3) function.  
• sha512  - When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with the SHA512  
algorithm. The SHA512  algorithm must be supported by the crypt(3) function.  
• blowfish  - When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with the 
blowfish  algorithm. The blowfish  algorithm must be supported by the crypt(3) 
function.  
• gost_yescrypt  - When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with the 
gost-yescrypt  algorithm. The gost-yescrypt  algorithm must be supported by the 
crypt(3) function.  
• yescrypt  - When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with the 
yescrypt  algorithm. The yescrypt  algorithm must be supported by the crypt(3) 
function.  
Rationale:  
The SHA-512 and yescrypt  algorithms provide a stronger hash than other algorithms 
used by Linux for password hash generation. A stronger hash provides additional 
protection to the system by increasing the level of effort needed for an attacker to 
successfully determine local user  passwords.

PASS_MAX_DAYS  <N> - The maximum number of days a password may be used. If the 
password is older than this, a password change will be forced. If not specified, -1 will be 
assumed (which disables the restriction).","The window of opportunity for an attacker to leverage compromised credentials or 
successfully compromise credentials via an online brute force attack is limited by the 
age of the password. Therefore, reducing the maximum age of a password also reduces 
an attacker's window of opportunity.  
We recommend a yearly password change. This is primarily because for all their good 
intentions users will share credentials across accounts. Therefore, even if a breach is 
publicly identified, the user may not see this notification, or forget they have an account 
on that site. This could leave a shared credential vulnerable indefinitely. Having an 
organizational policy of a 1 -year (annual) password expiration is a reasonable 
compromise to mitigate this with minimal user burden.  
   
Internal Only - General  Impact:  
The password expiration must be greater than the minimum days between password 
changes or users will be unable to change their password.  
Excessive password expiration requirements do more harm than good, because these 
requirements make users select predictable passwords, composed of sequential words 
and numbers that are closely related to each other. In these cases, the next password 
can be  predicted based on the previous one (incrementing a number used in the 
password for example). Also, password expiration requirements offer no containment 
benefits because attackers will often use credentials as soon as they compromise them. 
Instead, immed iate password changes should be based on key events including, but not 
limited to:  
• Indication of compromise  
• Change of user roles  
• When a user leaves the organization.  
Not only does changing passwords every few weeks or months frustrate the user, but 
it’s also been  suggested that it does more harm than good, because it could lead to bad 
practices by the user such as adding a character to the end of their existing password.","Run the following command and verify PASS_MAX_DAYS  is set to 365 days or less and

Impact:

the time defined by minimum password age. In this event the user should follow loc al

(Automated)  
Profile Applicability:  
•  Level 1 - Server  
•  Level 1 - Workstation  
Description:  
A cryptographic hash function converts an arbitrary -length input into a fixed length 
output. Password hashing performs a one -way transformation of a password, turning 
the password into another string, called the hashed password.  
ENCRYPT_METHOD  (string) - This defines the system default encryption algorithm for 
encrypting passwords (if no algorithm are specified on the command line). It can take 
one of these values:  
• MD5 - MD5 -based algorithm will be used for encrypting password  
• SHA256  - SHA256 -based algorithm will be used for encrypting password  
• SHA512  - SHA512 -based algorithm will be used for encrypting password  
• BCRYPT  - BCRYPT -based algorithm will be used for encrypting password  
• YESCRYPT  - YESCRYPT -based algorithm will be used for encrypting password  
• DES - DES-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password (default)  
Note:  
• This parameter overrides the deprecated MD5_CRYPT_ENAB  variable.  
• This parameter will only affect the generation of group passwords.  
• The generation of user passwords is done by PAM and subject to the PAM 
configuration.  
• It is recommended to set this variable consistently with the PAM configuration.  
Rationale:  
The SHA-512 and yescrypt  algorithms provide a stronger hash than other algorithms 
used by Linux for password hash generation. A stronger hash provides additional 
protection to the system by increasing the level of effort needed for an attacker to 
successfully determine local grou p passwords.  
   
Internal Only - General  Audit:  
Run the following command to verify the hashing algorithm is sha512  or yescrypt  in 
/etc/login.defs : 
# grep -Pi -- '^\h*ENCRYPT_METHOD \h+(SHA512|yescrypt) \b' /etc/login.defs  
Example output:

Note:  
• This only effects local groups' passwords created after updating the file to use 
sha512  or yescrypt . 
• If it is determined that the password algorithm being used is not sha512  or 
yescrypt , once it is changed, it is recommended that all group passwords be 
updated to use the stronger hashing algorithm.

Internal Only - General  5.4.3.2 Ensure default user shell timeout is configured 
(Automated)  
Profile Applicability:  
•  Level 1 - Server  
•  Level 1 - Workstation  
Description:  
TMOUT  is an environmental setting that determines the timeout of a shell in seconds.  
• TMOUT= n - Sets the shell timeout to n seconds. A setting of TMOUT=0  disables 
timeout.  
• readonly TMOUT - Sets the TMOUT environmental variable as readonly, 
preventing unwanted modification during run -time.  
• export TMOUT - exports the TMOUT variable  
System Wide Shell Configuration Files:  
• /etc/profile  - used to set system wide environmental variables on users shells. 
The variables are sometimes the same ones that are in the .bash_profile , 
however this file is used to set an initial PATH or PS1 for all shell users of the 
system. is only executed for interactive login  shells, or shells executed with 
the --login parameter.   
• /etc/profile.d  - /etc/profile  will execute the scripts within 
/etc/profile.d/*.sh . It is recommended to place your configuration in a shell 
script within /etc/profile.d  to set your own system wide environmental 
variables.  
• /etc/bashrc  - System wide version of .bashrc . In Fedora derived distributions, 
/etc/bashrc  also invokes /etc/profile.d/*.sh if non-login  shell, but redirects output 
to /dev/null  if non-interactive.  Is only executed for interactive  shells or if 
BASH_ENV  is set to /etc/bashrc .  
Rationale:  
Setting a timeout value reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized user access 
to another user's shell session that has been left unattended. It also ends the inactive 
session and releases the resources associated with that session.  
   
Internal Only - General  Audit:  
Run the following script to verify that TMOUT  is configured to: include a timeout of no 
more than 900 seconds, to be readonly , to be exported , and is not being changed to a 
longer timeout.

} 
   
Internal Only - General  Remediation:  
Review /etc/bashrc , /etc/profile , and all files ending in *.sh in the /etc/profile.d/  
directory and remove or edit all TMOUT=_n_  entries to follow local site policy. TMOUT  
should not exceed 900 or be equal to 0. 
Configure TMOUT  in one of the following files:  
• A file in the /etc/profile.d/  directory ending in .sh 
• /etc/profile  
• /etc/bashrc  
TMOUT  configuration examples:  
• As multiple lines:  
TMOUT=900  
readonly TMOUT  
export TMOUT  
• As a single line:  
readonly TMOUT=900 ; export TMOUT  
Additional Information:  
The audit and remediation in this recommendation apply to bash and shell. If other 
shells are supported on the system, it is recommended that their configuration files also 
are checked. Other methods of setting a timeout exist for other shells not covered here.  
Ensure that the timeout conforms to your local policy.

newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for any newly 
created directory is 0777 ( rwxrwxrwx ), and for any newly created file it is 0666 ( rw-rw-
rw-). The umask  modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these 
permissions. The umask  is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the 
umask  are cleared in the resulting file mode.  
umask  can be set with either Octal  or Symbolic  values:  
• Octal  (Numeric) Value - Represented by either three or four digits. ie umask 0027

three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other 
respectively.  
• Symbolic  Value - Represented by a comma separated list for User u, group g, 
and world/other o. The permissions listed are not masked by umask . ie a umask  
set by umask u=rwx,g=rx,o=  is the Symbolic  equivalent of the Octal  umask 027 .

Internal Only - General  6 Logging and Auditing  
The items in this section describe how to configure logging, log monitoring, and 
auditing, using tools included in most distributions.  
It is recommended that rsyslog be used for logging (with logwatch providing 
summarization) and auditd  be used for auditing (with aureport providing 
summarization) to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious 
system behavior.  
In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also 
recommended that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log 
server via an encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites 
correlate events that may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy 
of the system log information may be critical after a system compromise where the 
attacker has modified the local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation 
system is deployed, configure it to process the logs described in this section.  
Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems 
(particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized 
among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet 
protocol for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is 
supported by most network -ready devices. Reference < http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/ > 
manual page for more information on configuring chrony.  
It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and 
correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more 
significant when compared to an entry in another log.  
Note on log file permissions:  There really isn't a ""one size fits all"" solution to the 
permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who 
are in a defined security group, such as ""wheel"" do not have to elevate privileges to root 
in order to read log files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to 
have group permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid 
to root. Therefore, there are two remediation and audit st eps for log file permissions. 
One is for systems that do not have a secured group method implemented that only 
permits root to read the log files ( root:root 600 ). The other is for sites that do have 
such a setup and are designated as root:securegrp 640 where securegrp  is the 
defined security group (in some cases wheel ).",TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,5.4.3.3,Ensure default user umask is configured,TRUE,224

Internal Only - General  6.2 System Logging  
Logging services should be configured to prevent information leaks and to aggregate 
logs on a remote server so that they can be reviewed in the event of a system 
compromise. A centralized log server provides a single point of entry for further 
analysis, mo nitoring and filtering.  
Security principals for logging  
• Ensure transport layer security is implemented between the client and the log 
server.  
• Ensure that logs are rotated as per the environment requirements.  
• Ensure all locally generated logs have the appropriate permissions.  
• Ensure all security logs are sent to a remote log server.  
• Ensure the required events are logged.  
What is covered  
This section will cover the minimum best practices for the usage of journald . 
• If your organization makes use of another logging system such as rsyslog  or an 
enterprise wide logging system completely outside of journald , then the 
following recommendations do not directly apply. However, the principals of the 
recommendations should be followed regardless of what solution is implemented. 
If the enterprise solution incorporates journald , careful consideration should be 
given to the following recommendations to determine exactly what applies.  
What is not covered  
• Enterprise logging systems not utilizing journald . As logging is very situational 
and dependent on the local environment, not everything can be covered here.  
• Transport layer security should be applied to all remote logging functionality. 
journald  supports secure transport and should be configured as such.  
• The log server. There are a multitude of reasons for a centralized log server (and 
keeping a short period logging on the local system), but the log server is out of 
scope for these recommendations.  
   
Internal Only - General  6.2.1 Configure journald  
Included in the systemd suite is a journaling service called systemd-journald.service  
for the collection and storage of logging data. It creates and maintains structured, 
indexed journals based on logging information that is received from a variety of sources 
such as:  
• Classic RFC3164 BSD syslog via the /dev/log socket  
• STDOUT/STDERR of programs via StandardOutput=journal + 
StandardError=journal in service files (both of which are default settings)  
• Kernel log messages via the /dev/kmsg device node  
• Audit records via the kernel’s audit subsystem  
• Structured log messages via journald’s native protocol

Internal Only - General  6.3 System Auditing  
The Linux Auditing System operates on a set of rules that collects certain types of 
system activity to facilitate incident investigation, detect unauthorized access or 
modification of data. By default events will be logged to /var/log/audit/audit.log , 
which can be configured in /etc/audit/auditd.conf . 
The following types of audit rules can be specified:  
• Control rules: Configuration of the auditing system.  
• File system rules: Allow the auditing of access to a particular file or a directory. 
Also known as file watches.  
• System call rules: Allow logging of system calls that any specified program 
makes.  
Audit rules can be set:  
• On the command line using the auditctl  utility. These rules are not persistent 
across reboots.  
• In /etc/audit/audit.rules . These rules have to be merged and loaded before 
they are active.  
Notes:  
• For 64 bit systems that have arch as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: 
one for 64 bit and one for 32 bit systems calls.  
• If the auditing system is configured to be locked ( -e 2), a system reboot will be 
required in order to load any changes.  
• Key names are optional on the rules and will not be used as a compliance 
auditing. The usage of key names is highly recommended as it facilitates 
organization and searching, as such, all remediation steps will have key names 
supplied.  
• It is best practice to store the rules, in number prepended files, in 
/etc/audit/rules.d/ . Rules must end in a .rules  suffix. This then requires the 
use of augenrules  to merge all the rules into /etc/audit/audit.rules  based on 
their their alphabetical (lexical) sort order. All benchmark recommendations 
follow this best practice for remediation, specifically using the prefix of 50 which is 
centre weighed if all rule sets make use of the number prepending naming 
convention.  
• Your system may have been customized to change the default UID_MIN . All 
samples output uses 1000, but this value will not be used in compliance auditing. 
To confirm the UID_MIN  for your system, run the following command: awk 
'/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs   
   
Internal Only - General  Normalization  
The Audit system normalizes some entries, so when you look at the sample output keep 
in mind that:  
• With regards to users whose login UID is not set, the values -1 / unset  / 
4294967295  are equivalent and normalized to -1. 
• When comparing field types and both sides of the comparison is valid fields 
types, such as euid!=uid , then the auditing system may normalize such that the 
output is uid!=euid . 
• Some parts of the rule may be rearranged whilst others are dependant on 
previous syntax. For example, the following two statements are the same:  
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F auid!= -1 -F 
key=user_emulation  
and 
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset -S execve -k 
user_emulation  
Capacity planning  
The recommendations in this section implement auditing policies that not only produces 
large quantities of logged data, but may also negatively impact system performance. 
Capacity planning is critical in order not to adversely impact production environment s. 
• Disk space. If a significantly large set of events are captured, additional on 
system or off system storage may need to be allocated. If the logs are not sent to 
a remote log server, ensure that log rotation is implemented else the disk will fill 
up and th e system will halt. Even when logs are sent to a log server, ensure 
sufficient disk space to allow caching of logs in the case of temporary network 
outages.  
• Disk IO. It is not just the amount of data collected that should be considered, but 
the rate at which logs are generated.  
• CPU overhead. System call rules might incur considerable CPU overhead. Test 
the systems open/close syscalls per second with and without the rules to gauge 
the impact of the rules.",TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,6.2.2.1,Ensure access to all logfiles has been configured,TRUE,238

OR - halt: 
grep -Pi -- '^\h*admin_space_left_action \h*=\h*(single|halt) \b'

• /etc/hosts  - file containing host names and associated IP addresses  
• /etc/networks  - symbolic names for networks  
• /etc/network/  - directory containing network interface scripts and configurations 
files 
• /etc/netplan/  - central location for YAML networking configurations files","Monitoring system events that change network environments, such as sethostname  and 
setdomainname , helps identify unauthorized alterations to host and domain names, 
which could compromise security settings reliant on these names. Changes to 
/etc/hosts  can signal unauthorized attempts to alter machine associations with IP 
addresses, potentially redirecting users and processes to unintended destinations. 
Surveillance of /etc/issue  and /etc/issue.net  is crucial to detect intruders inserting 
false information to  deceive users. Monitoring /etc/network/  reveals modifications to 
network interfaces or scripts that may jeopardize system availability or security. 
Additionally, tracking changes in the /etc/netplan/  directory ensures swift detection of 
unauthorized adjustments to network configurations. All audit records should be 
appropriately tagged for relevance

large file systems without these mount options, such traversal will be significantly 
detrimental to the performance of the system.

passwords are saved in shadow password file, /etc/shadow , encrypted by a salted one -
way hash. Accounts with a shadowed password have an x in the second field in 
/etc/passwd .","The /etc/passwd  file also contains information like user ID's and group ID's that are 
used by many system programs. Therefore, the /etc/passwd  file must remain world 
readable. In spite of encoding the password with a randomly -generated one -way hash 
function, an attacker could still break the system if they got access to the /etc/passwd  
file. This can be mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in 
the /etc/passwd  file to /etc/shadow . The /etc/shadow  file is set so only root will be able 
to read and write. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the 
encoded passwords with which to perform a dictionary at tack.

Additional Information:  
The pwconv  command creates shadow from passwd  and an optionally existing shadow . 
• The pwunconv  command creates passwd  from passwd  and shadow  and then 
removes shadow . 
• The grpconv  command creates gshadow  from group  and an optionally existing 
gshadow . 
• The grpunconv  command creates group  from group  and gshadow  and then 
removes gshadow . 
These four programs all operate on the normal and shadow password and group files: 
/etc/passwd , /etc/group , /etc/shadow , and /etc/gshadow . 
Each program acquires the necessary locks before conversion. pwconv  and grpconv  are 
similar. First, entries in the shadowed file which don't exist in the main file are removed. 
Then, shadowed entries which don't have x' as the password in the main file are 
updated. Any missing shadowed entries are added. Finally, passwords in the 
main file are replaced with x'. These programs can be used for initial conversion as 
well to update the shadowed file if the main file is edited by hand.  
pwconv  will use the values of PASS_MIN_DAYS , PASS_MAX_DAYS , and PASS_WARN_AGE  from 
/etc/login.defs when adding new entries to /etc/shadow.  
pwunconv  and grpunconv  are similar. Passwords in the main file are updated from the 
shadowed file. Entries which exist in the main file but not in the shadowed file are left 
alone. Finally, the shadowed file is removed. Some password aging information is lost 
by pwunconv . It will convert what it can.
