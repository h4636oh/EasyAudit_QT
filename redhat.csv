"1.1.1.9 Ensure unused filesystems kernel modules are not 
available (Manual)","•  Level 1 - Server  
•  Level 1 - Workstation","Filesystem kernel modules are pieces of code that can be dynamically loaded into the 
Linux kernel to extend its filesystem capabilities, or so -called base kernel, of an 
operating system. Filesystem kernel modules are typically used to add support for new 
hardware (as device drivers), or for adding system calls.","While loadable filesystem kernel modules are a convenient method of modifying the 
running kernel, this can be abused by attackers on a compromised system to prevent 
detection of their processes or files, allowing them to maintain control over the system. 
Many rootkits make use of loadable filesystem kernel modules in this way.  
Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the 
system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it. The following filesystem kernel

1.1.2.1.1 Ensure /tmp is a separate partition (Automated),"•  Level 1 - Server  
•  Level 1 - Workstation","The /tmp  directory is a world -writable directory used for temporary storage by all users 
and some applications.  
- IF - an entry for /tmp  exists in /etc/fstab  it will take precedence over entries in 
systemd default unit file.  
Note:  In an environment where the main system is diskless and connected to iSCSI, 
entries in /etc/fstab  may not take precedence.  
/tmp  can be configured to use tmpfs . 
tmpfs  puts everything into the kernel internal caches and grows and shrinks to 
accommodate the files it contains and is able to swap unneeded pages out to swap 
space. It has maximum size limits which can be adjusted on the fly via mount -o 
remount . 
Since tmpfs  lives completely in the page cache and on swap, all tmpfs  pages will be 
shown as ""Shmem"" in /proc/meminfo  and ""Shared"" in free . Notice that these 
counters also include shared memory. The most reliable way to get the count is using 
df and du. 
tmpfs  has three mount options for sizing:  
• size : The limit of allocated bytes for this tmpfs  instance. The default is half of 
your physical RAM without swap. If you oversize your tmpfs  instances the 
machine will deadlock since the OOM handler will not be able to free that 
memory.  
• nr_blocks : The same as size, but in blocks of PAGE_SIZE.  
• nr_inodes : The maximum number of inodes for this instance. The default is half 
of the number of your physical RAM pages, or (on a machine with highmem) the 
number of lowmem RAM pages, whichever is the lower.  
These parameters accept a suffix k, m or g and can be changed on remount. The size 
parameter also accepts a suffix % to limit this tmpfs  instance to that percentage of your 
physical RAM. The default, when neither size  nor nr_blocks  is specified, is size=50% .","Making /tmp  its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options 
such as the noexec  option on the mount, making /tmp  useless for an attacker to install 
executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a 
system setuid  program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, 
the hard link would be broken, and the attacker would have his own copy of the 
program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could 
continue to exploit the known flaw.  
This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs  to /tmp , or creating a separate 
partition for /tmp . 
Impact:  
By design files saved to /tmp  should have no expectation of surviving a reboot of the 
system. tmpfs  is ram based and all files stored to tmpfs  will be lost when the system is 
rebooted.  
If files need to be persistent through a reboot, they should be saved to /var/tmp  not 
/tmp . 
Since the /tmp  directory is intended to be world -writable, there is a risk of resource 
exhaustion if it is not bound to tmpfs  or a separate partition.  
Running out of /tmp  space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under 
it, but in a configuration where /tmp  is not a separate file system it will essentially have 
the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single / partition. On 
the other hand, a RAM -based /tmp  (as with tmpfs ) will almost certainly be much 
smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. 
Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for /tmp  from a separ ate volume or 
disk. One of the downsides of a disk -based dedicated partition is that it will be slower 
than tmpfs  which is RAM -based.","Run the following command and verify the output shows that /tmp  is mounted. 
Particular requirements pertaining to mount options are covered in ensuing sections.  
# findmnt -kn /tmp 
Example output:

Verify output is not masked  or disabled . 
Note:  By default, systemd will output generated  if there is an entry in /etc/fstab  for

Profile Applicability:  
•  Level 2 - Server  
•  Level 2 - Workstation  
Description:  
The /home  directory is used to support disk storage needs of local users.  
Rationale:  
The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /home  directory 
contains user generated data, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially 
have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, 
other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /home  and impact all 
local users.  
Configuring /home  as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount 
options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev . These options limit an attacker's ability to 
create exploits on the system. In the case of /home  options such as 
usrquota/grpquota  may be considered to limit the impact that users can have on each 
other with regards to disk resource exhaustion. Other options allow for specific 
behavior. See man mount  for exact details regarding filesystem -independent and 
filesystem -specific options.  
As /home  contains user data, care should be taken to ensure the security and integrity 
of the data and mount point.  
Impact:  
Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud -hosted servers. Separate filesystem 
partitions may prevent successful resizing or may require the installation of additional 
tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional  tools may 
introduce their own security considerations.  
   Audit:  
Run the following command and verify output shows /home  is mounted:  
# findmnt -kn /home  
 
/home   /dev/sdb  ext4  rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,seclabel  
Remediation:  
For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a 
separate partition for /home . 
For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure 
/etc/fstab  as appropriate.

The format of the package ( gpg-pubkey-9db62fb1 -59920156 ) is important to 
understand for verification. Using the above example, it consists of three parts:  
1. The general prefix name for all imported GPG keys: gpg-pubkey- 
2. The version, which is the GPG key ID: 9db62fb1  
3. The release is the date of the key in UNIX timestamp in hexadecimal: 59920156  
With both the date and the GPG key ID, check the relevant repositories public key page 
to confirm that the keys are indeed correct.  
Query locally available GPG keys  
Repositories that store their respective GPG keys on disk should do so in 
/etc/pki/rpm -gpg/ . These keys are available for immediate import either when dnf is 
asked to install a relevant package from the repository or when an administrator imports 
the key directly with the rpm --import  command.  
To find where these keys come from run:

The system -wide crypto -policies followed by the crypto core components allow 
consistently deprecating and disabling algorithms system -wide.  
The LEGACY  policy ensures maximum compatibility with version 5 of the operating

- IF - FIPS is required by local site policy:  
The system -wide cryptographic policies contain a policy level that enables cryptographic 
algorithms in accordance with the requirements by the Federal Information Processing 
Standard (FIPS) Publication 140. The fips -mode -setup tool that enables or disables  
FIPS mode internally uses the FIPS systemwide cryptographic policy. Switching the 
system to FIPS mode by using the FIPS system -wide cryptographic policy does not 
guarantee compliance with the FIPS 140 standard. Re -generating all cryptographic keys 
after s etting the system to FIPS mode may not be possible. For example, in the case of 
an existing IdM realm with users' cryptographic keys you cannot re -generate all the 
keys. The fips -mode -setup tool uses the FIPS policy internally. But on top of what the 
update-crypto-policies  command with the --set FIPS  option does, fips-mode-
setup  ensures the installation of the FIPS dracut  module by using the fips-finish-
install  tool, it also adds the fips=1  boot option to the kernel command line and 
regenerates the initial ramdisk.  
IMPORTANT:  Only enabling FIPS mode during installation ensures that the system 
generates all keys with FIPS -approved algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in 
place.  
Run the following command to switch the system to FIPS mode:  
# fips-mode-setup --enable 
Output:  
Kernel initramdisks are being regenerated. This might take some time.  
Setting system policy to FIPS  
Note: System -wide crypto policies are applied on application start -up. 
It is recommended to restart the system for the change of policies  
to fully take place.  
FIPS mode will be enabled.  
Please reboot the system for the setting to take effect.  
Run the following command to restart the system:  
# reboot  
After the reboot has completed, run the following command to verify FIPS mode:

•  Level 1 - Workstation","The rpcbind  utility maps RPC services to the ports on which they listen. RPC 
processes notify rpcbind  when they start, registering the ports they are listening on and 
the RPC program numbers they expect to serve. The client system then contacts 
rpcbind  on the server with a particular RPC program number. The rpcbind.service  
redirects the client to the proper port number so it can communicate with the requested 
service.  
Portmapper is an RPC service, which always listens on tcp and udp 111, and is used to 
map other RPC services (such as nfs, nlockmgr, quotad, mountd, etc.) to their 
corresponding port number on the server. When a remote host makes an RPC call to 
that server , it first consults with portmap to determine where the RPC server is listening.","A small request (~82 bytes via UDP) sent to the Portmapper generates a large 
response (7x to 28x amplification), which makes it a suitable tool for DDoS attacks. If 
rpcbind  is not required, it is recommended to remove rpcbind  package to reduce the 
potential attack surface.

(Automated)","•  Level 1 - Server  
•  Level 1 - Workstation","crontab  is the program used to install, deinstall, or list the tables used to drive the cron 
daemon. Each user can have their own crontab, and though these are files in 
/var/spool/cron/crontabs , they are not intended to be edited directly.  
If the /etc/cron.allow  file exists, then you must be listed (one user per line) therein in 
order to be allowed to use this command. If the /etc/cron.allow  file does not exist but 
the /etc/cron.deny  file does exist, then you must not be listed in the /etc/cron.deny  
file in order to use this command.  
If neither of these files exists, then depending on site -dependent configuration 
parameters, only the super user will be allowed to use this command, or all users will be 
able to use this command.  
If both files exist then /etc/cron.allow  takes precedence. Which means that 
/etc/cron.deny  is not considered and your user must be listed in /etc/cron.allow  
in order to be able to use the crontab.  
Regardless of the existence of any of these files, the root administrative user is always 
allowed to setup a crontab.  
The files /etc/cron.allow  and /etc/cron.deny , if they exist, must be either world -
readable, or readable by group crontab . If they are not, then cron will deny access to 
all users until the permissions are fixed.  
There is one file for each user's crontab under the /var/spool/cron/crontabs  
directory. Users are not allowed to edit the files under that directory directly to ensure 
that only users allowed by the system to run periodic tasks can add them, and only 
syntactically correct crontabs will be written there. This is enforced by having t he 
directory writable only by the crontab  group and configuring crontab command with the 
setgid bid set for that specific group.  
Note:  
• Even though a given user is not listed in cron.allow , cron jobs can still be run 
as that user  
• The files /etc/cron.allow  and /etc/cron.deny , if they exist, only controls 
administrative access to the crontab command for scheduling and modifying cron 
jobs","On many systems, only the system administrator is authorized to schedule cron  jobs. 
Using the cron.allow  file to control who can run cron  jobs enforces this policy. It is

Firewalls act as digital gatekeepers by filtering network traffic based on rules. Proper 
firewall configurations ensure that only legitimate traffic gets processed,  reducing the 
system’s exposure to potential threats. The choice between FirewallD and NFTables 
depends on organizational specific needs:  
FirewallD  - Is a firewall service daemon that provides a dynamic customizable host -
based firewall with a D -Bus interface. Being dynamic, it enables creating, changing, and 
deleting the rules without the necessity to restart the firewall daemon each time the 
rules a re changed.  
NFTables  - Includes the nft utility for configuration of the nftables subsystem of the 
Linux kernel.  
Notes:  
• firewalld with nftables backend does not support passing custom nftables rules to 
firewalld, using the --direct  option.  
• In order to configure firewall rules for nftables, a firewall utility needs to be 
installed and active of the system. The use of more than one firewall utility may 
produce unexpected results.  
• Allow port 22(ssh) needs to be updated to only allow systems requiring ssh 
connectivity to connect, as per site policy.","Proper configuration of a single firewall utility minimizes cyber threats and protects

•  Level 2 - Server","The DisableForwarding  parameter disables all forwarding features, including X11, 
ssh-agent(1), TCP and StreamLocal. This option overrides all other forwarding -related 
options and may simplify restricted configurations.  
• X11Forwarding provides the ability to tunnel X11 traffic through the connection to 
enable remote graphic connections.  
• ssh-agent is a program to hold private keys used for public key authentication. 
Through use of environment variables the agent can be located and 
automatically used for authentication when logging in to other machines using 
ssh. 
• SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from 
the client to the server, or servers to clients. It can be used for adding encryption 
to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some system administrators 
and IT prof essionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from 
their home machines.","Disable X11 forwarding unless there is an operational requirement to use X11 
applications directly. There is a small risk that the remote X11 servers of users who are 
logged in via SSH with X11 forwarding could be compromised by other users on the 
X11 serv er. Note that even if X11 forwarding is disabled, users can always install their 
own forwarders.  
anyone with root privilege on the the intermediate server can make free use of ssh -
agent to authenticate them to other servers  
Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and 
backdoors. SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their 
contents invisible to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. 
This invisibility carries considerable risk potential if it is used for malicious purposes 
such as data exfiltration. Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their 
unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network.   Impact:  
SSH tunnels are widely used in many corporate environments. In some environments 
the applications themselves may have very limited native support for security. By 
utilizing tunneling, compliance with SOX, HIPAA, PCI -DSS, and other standards can be 
achieved  without having to modify the applications.","Run the following command to verify DisableForwarding  is set to yes:

"5.1.9 Ensure sshd ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax 
are configured (Automated)","•  Level 1 - Server  
•  Level 1 - Workstation","Note:  To clarify, the two settings described below are only meant for idle connections 
from a protocol perspective and are not meant to check if the user is active or not. An 
idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not and never had, intentionally,  
the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before 8.2p1  there was a bug that 
caused these values to behave in such a manner that they were abused to disconnect 
idle users. This bug has been resolved in 8.2p1  and thus it can no longer be abuse d 
disconnect idle users.  
The two options ClientAliveInterval  and ClientAliveCountMax  control the timeout 
of SSH sessions. Taken directly from man 5 sshd_config : 
• ClientAliveInterval  Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data 
has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the 
encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, 
indicating that these messages will not be sent  to the client.  
• ClientAliveCountMax  Sets the number of client alive messages which may be 
sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this 
threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will 
disconnect the client, terminating the session. It is  important to note that the use 
of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive 
messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be 
spoofable. The TCP keepalive option en ‐abled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. 
The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on 
knowing when a connection has become unresponsive. The default value is 3. If 
ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left a t the default, 
unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. 
Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination.","In order to prevent resource exhaustion, appropriate values should be set for both 
ClientAliveInterval  and ClientAliveCountMax . Specifically, looking at the source 
code, ClientAliveCountMax  must be greater than zero in order to utilize the ability of 
SSH to drop idle connections. If connections are allowed to stay open indefinitely, this 
can potentially be used as a DDOS attack or simple resource exhaustion could occur 
over unreliable networ ks. 
The example set here is a 45 second timeout. Consult your site policy for network 
timeouts and apply as appropriate.","Run the following command and verify ClientAliveInterval  and 
ClientAliveCountMax  are greater than zero:  
# sshd -T | grep -Pi -- '(clientaliveinterval|clientalivecountmax)'  
Example Output:

• The example is based on a custom profile built (copied) from the the SSSD  default

• The example does not include the symlink  option for the PAM or Metadata  files. 
This is due to the fact that by linking the PAM files future updates to authselect  
may overwrite local site customizations to the custom profile  
• The --backup=PAM_CONFIG_BACKUP  option will create a backup of the current

Some unexpected changes to the configuration were detected. Use 'select'

   Additional Information:  
with the option --base-on=BASE-ID or -b=BASE-ID the new profile will be based on a 
profile named BASE -ID. 
The base profile location is determined with these steps:  
1. If BASE -ID starts with prefix custom/ it is a custom profile.  
2. Try if BASE -ID is found in vendor profiles.  
3. Try if BASE -ID is found in default profiles.  
4. Return an error.  
The authselect option --force  or -f will cause authselect to write changes even if the 
previous configuration was not created by authselect but by other tool or by manual

5.4.1.1 Ensure password expiration is configured (Automated),"•  Level 1 - Server  
•  Level 1 - Workstation","The PASS_MAX_DAYS  parameter in /etc/login.defs  allows an administrator to force 
passwords to expire once they reach a defined age.  
PASS_MAX_DAYS  <N> - The maximum number of days a password may be used. If the 
password is older than this, a password change will be forced. If not specified, -1 will be 
assumed (which disables the restriction).","The window of opportunity for an attacker to leverage compromised credentials or 
successfully compromise credentials via an online brute force attack is limited by the 
age of the password. Therefore, reducing the maximum age of a password also reduces 
an attacker's window of opportunity.  
We recommend a yearly password change. This is primarily because for all their good 
intentions users will share credentials across accounts. Therefore, even if a breach is 
publicly identified, the user may not see this notification, or forget they have an account 
on that site. This could leave a shared credential vulnerable indefinitely. Having an 
organizational policy of a 1 -year (annual) password expiration is a reasonable 
compromise to mitigate this with minimal user burden.  
   Impact:  
The password expiration must be greater than the minimum days between password 
changes or users will be unable to change their password.  
Excessive password expiration requirements do more harm than good, because these 
requirements make users select predictable passwords, composed of sequential words 
and numbers that are closely related to each other. In these cases, the next password 
can be  predicted based on the previous one (incrementing a number used in the 
password for example). Also, password expiration requirements offer no containment 
benefits because attackers will often use credentials as soon as they compromise them. 
Instead, immed iate password changes should be based on key events including, but not 
limited to:  
• Indication of compromise  
• Change of user roles  
• When a user leaves the organization.  
Not only does changing passwords every few weeks or months frustrate the user, but 
it’s also been suggested that it does more harm than good, because it could lead to bad 
practices by the user such as adding a character to the end of their existing passwor d.","Run the following command and verify PASS_MAX_DAYS  is set to 365 days or less and

As noted in the systemd-journald  man pages, systemd-journald  logs may be 
exported to rsyslog  either through the process mentioned here, or through a facility 
like systemd-journald.service . There are trade -offs involved in each 
implementation, where ForwardToSyslog  will immediately capture all events (and 
forward to an external log server, if properly configured), but may not capture all boot -up 
activities. Mechanisms such as systemd-journald.service , on the other hand, will 
record bootup events, but may del ay sending the information to rsyslog , leading to the 
potential for log manipulation prior to export. Be aware of the limitations of all tools

grubby  is a command line tool used to configure bootloader menu entries across 
multiple architectures. It is used for updating and displaying information about the 
configuration files for various architecture specific bootloaders.  
It is primarily designed to be used from scripts which install new kernels and need to 
find information about the current boot environment.  
The grubby executable has full support for the grub2 bootloader on x86_64 systems 
using legacy BIOS or modern UEFI firmware and ppc64 and ppc64le hardware using 
OPAL or SLOF as firmware.  
Legacy s390 and the current s390x architectures and their zipl bootloader are fully 
supported.  
Support for yaboot has been deprecated as all ppc architecture hardware since the 
Power8 uses grub2 or petitboot which both use the grub2 configuration file format.  
Legacy bootloaders LILO, SILO, and ELILO are deprecated and no longer receiving 
active support in favor of previously mentioned bootloaders.  
The default bootloader target is primarily determined by the architecture for which 
grubby has been built. Each architecture has a preferred bootloader, and each 
bootloader has its own configuration file. If no bootloader is selected on the command 
line, g rubby will use these default settings to search for an existing configuration. If no 
bootloader configuration file is found, grubby will use the default value for that 
architecture.   CIS Controls:

passwords are saved in shadow password file, /etc/shadow , encrypted by a salted 
one-way hash. Accounts with a shadowed password have an x in the second field in 
/etc/passwd .","The /etc/passwd  file also contains information like user ID's and group ID's that are 
used by many system programs. Therefore, the /etc/passwd  file must remain world 
readable. In spite of encoding the password with a randomly -generated one -way hash 
function, an attacker could still break the system if they got access to the /etc/passwd  
file. This can be mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in 
the /etc/passwd  file to /etc/shadow . The /etc/shadow  file is set so only root will be 
able to read and write. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the 
encoded passwords with which to perform a dictionary attack.  
Note:  
• All accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from 
being used by an unauthorized user.

Additional Information:  
The pwconv  command creates shadow from passwd  and an optionally existing shadow . 
• The pwunconv  command creates passwd  from passwd  and shadow  and then 
removes shadow . 
• The grpconv  command creates gshadow  from group  and an optionally existing 
gshadow . 
• The grpunconv  command creates group  from group  and gshadow  and then 
removes gshadow . 
These four programs all operate on the normal and shadow password and group files: 
/etc/passwd , /etc/group , /etc/shadow , and /etc/gshadow . 
Each program acquires the necessary locks before conversion. pwconv  and grpconv  
are similar. First, entries in the shadowed file which don't exist in the main file are 
removed. Then, shadowed entries which don't have x' as the password in the 
main file are updated. Any missing shadowed entries are added. 
Finally, passwords in the main file are replaced with x'. These programs 
can be used for initial conversion as well to update the shadowed file if the main file is 
edited by hand.  
pwconv  will use the values of PASS_MIN_DAYS , PASS_MAX_DAYS , and PASS_WARN_AGE  
from /etc/login.defs when adding new entries to /etc/shadow.  
pwunconv  and grpunconv  are similar. Passwords in the main file are updated from the 
shadowed file. Entries which exist in the main file but not in the shadowed file are left 
alone. Finally, the shadowed file is removed. Some password aging information is lost 
by pwunconv . It will convert what it can.
